<HR>


NOTE: before trying these advanced topics, please try the standard <A HREF="yapt.htm">YAPT tutorial</A> with the Babe personality.
<P></P>
YAPT can be used with pre-existing personalities like Holiday Pleo (Xmas songs) or PleoPM (the default personality) that weren't meant to work with YAPT.
The old logic is replaced completely. You can reuse any of the resources (sounds, motions or animation 'commands').

<P></P>
<H2>Changing Holiday Pleo</H2>
<P></P>
The Holiday Pleo personality randomly picks between 6 Christmas songs.
For this tutorial, we are going to use YAPT to make a predictable behavior removing the random playing.
Pressing one of 6 sensors (head, back, 4 legs) will perform one specific song.
This is useful if you have more than 1 Pleo and want to trigger all of them to perform the same song.

<UL>
<LI>Prerequisite: Please work through the intro <A HREF="yapt.htm">YAPT tutorial</A> first, with the Babe personality.
<LI>Prerequisite: Please download and run the Holiday Pleo program first
<LI>If you haven't installed it already, download the 
<A HREF=http://www.pleoworld.com/downloads>Holiday Pleo from the UGOBE site</A>
and install it on the SD card.
There should be a PLEO.URF file in the top-most folder of the SD card.
<LI>Download the <A HREF="yapt01a.zip">yapt01a.zip</A> stand-alone install and unzip it to the top-most folder of the SD card.
(there should be 2 .AMX files, 2 .EXE files, one PLEO.Y file and the PLEO.URF file)
<P></P>
<LI>Run the YAPT.EXE program.
<LI>Initially, there is no behavior. Select "Startup" and press the top "Add" button. Add the motion "x_hohohoa".
That's a short intro skit so we know the Pleo has booted up properly.
<LI>At the main YAPT screen, select "Body"/"Head Release". Add the motion "x_song_merry_xmas".
<LI>At the main YAPT screen, select "Body"/"Back Release". Add the motion "x_song_jingle2".
<LI>At the main YAPT screen, select "Legs"/"Left Leg Release". Add the motion "x_song_12_days".
<LI>At the main YAPT screen, select "Legs"/"Right Leg Release". Add the motion "x_jingle_bells".
<LI>At the main YAPT screen, select "Legs"/"Left Arm Release". Add the motion "x_song_goodking".
<LI>At the main YAPT screen, select "Legs"/"Right Arm Release". Add the motion "x_deckhalls".

<LI>Geek Note: in the original Holiday Pleo, the random song selection is done with an Animation Command "x_rxn_song". You can assign it to another sensor if you like.
It will randomly pick a song like the original.
<P></P>
<LI>When you are done, press the "Save program to SD card" button on the bottom. Then press "OK".
<LI>If necessary 'stop' the SD card (required for some computers) and remove the SD card from the SD card reader and insert in Pleo SD slot.
<LI>Test it on Pleo. Pleo should say "ho ho ho" when it starts.
<LI>To trigger a song, hold one of the 6 assigned sensors (Head, Back, or 4 legs).
Hold your hand on the sensor for a second or two.
When you release your hand the song will start.
<LI>NOTE: The leg sensors are on the upper part of the legs (not to be confused with the foot sensors on the bottom of the feet)
<LI>NOTE: songs are not interruptable (that's how the YAPT personality works for now), so you will be forced to listen to the entire song ;->
<P></P>
<LI>NOTE: For synchronizing multiple Pleos, release the sensors all at the same time.
<LI>ADVICE: For quick reactions the 'Tap' sensors should be used. Pleo will react instantly.
For longer reactions the 'Hold' sensor condition should be used. This reduces the chance of a mis-trigger (eg: picking up Pleo).
Finally, use the 'Release' sensor condition if you want to be in control of the exact start of a skit (for making videos or multiple Pleo performances)
<P></P>
<LI>You can repeat the YAPT process with other motions and sounds on the Holiday Pleo personality. However there aren't that many canned motions to pick from.
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<P></P>
<H2>Changing PleoPM (the default personality)</H2>
<P></P>
Short answer: don't.
<BR>
Use the YAPT approach with the 'Babe' personality or a MySkit created personality.
These personalities have a sound and motion library at the end that is very similar to the PleoPM default personality.

<P></P>
<H2>Browsing PleoPM (the default personality)</H2>
You can use YAPT (and P3D) to browse the built-in sounds/motions/commands of the default personality (PleoPM), or any PLEO.URF you find.
<UL>
<LI>"Grab" the default PleoPM personality from your Pleo, to an SD card. Copy the Pleo.URF file to a folder on your PC.
<A HREF="tech2.htm#GRAB">Instructions for Grabbing PleoPM are here</A>.
You only need to do that once.
<BR>
The rest can be done on your PC (no SD card or Pleo required).
<P></P>
<LI>Download the <A HREF="yapt01a.zip">yapt01a.zip</A> stand-alone install and unzip it to that folder containing the PLEO.URF file.
<LI>Run YAPT. For this purpose, most of the features of YAPT are ignored. Press the top "Add" button and YAPT can be used as a sound/motion/command browser.
<LI>In the "Pick Action to add" dialog, check the "Auto Preview" checkbox at the bottom right.
<LI>You can browse through the Sounds, Motions and Commands of the default personality.
When you select them, they will be previewed in the P3D player.
<LI>For browsing purposes, don't double-click or "Add Action". When you are done with browsing, you can close YAPT and ignore any changes.
