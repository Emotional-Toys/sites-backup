<H2>Overview</H2>

Ever wonder what your AIBO is seeing, feeling and thinking ?<br>
If you have a memory stick reader, you can stop wondering !<br>
<P></P>
After you put a special hacked version of AiboWare on your dog's memory stick,
it will save a snapshot of what the dog is seeing, feeling and learning, about once every second.
<P></P>
AIBO Scope is a program that runs on your PC. It will display the captured data in a graphical format, showing a picture from the AIBO camera, what it is learning, and changes to the emotional and instinctive states of the dog.
<br><pre>   <img src="ss_scope.jpg"></pre></br>
AIBO Scope is informative: it tells you exactly what the dog is learning and when.
<br>
AIBO Scope is amusing: especially when the dog is flailing away trying to get back up after falling down.
<br>
AIBO Scope is more fun than a spy-cam: try leaving the dog alone in a room, and later come back to see what it was doing.
<HR>
<H2>Platforms</H2>
To use the AIBO scope, you need a memory stick reader and a PC.
The AIBO Trainer (AScope.EXE) is a Win32 program. It should work on Windows 95 and above.
<br>
You must patch an ERA-111A version of AiboWare on a 16MB purple memory stick.
This version of AiboScope will not work with older versions of AiboWare or on a standard 8MB stick.
<P></P>

<HR>
<H2>AIBO Instruction</H2>

<H3>AiboWare Installation - one-step install:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>You will need an 8MB or 16MB purple memory stick. This version will fit on an 8MB stick with enough room for a moderate amount of camera data.
<LI>Backup your memory stick if appropriate.
<LI>Delete all the existing files on the stick
<LI>Download this file <A HREF="scope1small.zip">scope1small.zip (1.7MB)</A> and unzip it on top of the blank stick.
<LI>Install the memory stick in your AIBO
<LI>Take some pictures (see part 1)
</UL>

<H3>AiboWare Installation - two-step install:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>You will need a 16MB purple memory stick. Do not try this on an 8MB memory stick.
<LI>Install the ERS-111 "A" version of AiboWare on your 16MB memory stick
<DIR>Other versions or smaller memory sticks are no longer supported</DIR>
<LI>If necessary, use <A HREF="../123/aibotool.htm">AiboTool</A> to select an active Youth or Adult personality (Rumble Dog is good)
<LI>Download this <A HREF="scope1patch.zip">scope1patch.zip</A> - self install scope patch
<LI>Unzip it on top of the memory stick, it will not replace any files
<LI>Run the "PATCH.BAT" file found at the root of the memory stick.
<LI>Check to make sure it is run successfully
<LI>Install the memory stick in your AIBO
<LI>Take some pictures (see part 1)
</UL>

<P></P>
<H3>How to use it - Part 1</H3>
With the patched AiboWare installed on the memory stick, you can put it in your dog and start him up as usual.
Everything should run as a normal AIBO. The only difference is that the LED on the back will stay on (or flash) while the dog is recording data.
If the dog runs out of memory stick space, it will just stop recording and turn off the Orange LED.
<P></P>

<P>IMPORTANT</P>
When you are done playing with the dog, you must press the dog's pause button and wait for the memory stick to finish writing, and the Orange LED to stop flashing.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>PC Instructions:</H2>
<P></P>
<H3>PC Installation</H3>
Next download the PC program that lets you view the captured images.
<UL>
<LI>Download the latest version of AIBO Scope: <A HREF="ascope.zip">ascope.zip</A>
<LI>Unzip it to your PC
<LI>The AIBO Scope program runs on your PC (under Windows). See Part 2
</UL>

<P></P>
<P></P>
<H2>How to use it - Part 2</H2>
After you've done the recording, place the memory stick into your PC stick reader. There will be a file called "SNAPSHOT.IBO" that contains the recorded information.
<br>
Run the new tool "AIBO Scope" (ASCOPE.EXE) on your PC. Open the "SNAPSHOT.IBO" file on the memory stick.
<br>
See above for Downloads.
<P></P>
The AIBO scope interface is pretty simple.
You can scroll down the screen to look at the different pictures.
Pictures are typically one second apart.
To the right of the pictures, you will see three columns.
<br>
The first column lists what is being learned.
The "time" number is the quality time (in 1/10th of seconds).
<br>
The second column shows the dog's emotional state. The bar graph showing the dog's current values. The text shows the changes in the dog's emotions. The text colors match the bar colors.
<br>
The third column lists in the dog's instinctive state.

<H2>Menu Commands</H2>
<P>File - Open</P>
Opens the "SNAPSHOT.IBO" file from the root of your memory stick.
You must have a file open to change the capture options.
<P>File - Print options</P>
File Print, Print Setup and Print Preview are partially implemented.
If you have any ideas on how/what you would like printed out, please email me.
<P>Capture - Save Images As...</P>
This will save the camera images as one big bitmap.
You can then use Chris's <A HREF=http://www.bussetech.com/aibo>AIBOAnim</A> to animate them.
<P>Capture - Capture Options...</P>
You can change the Capture rate (normally 1 per second). Saving the images to memory stick takes more than one second, so the actual capture rate will vary.
You can also set the capture options to turn on or off various features.
<br>
Changes made will affect the next time you put the memory stick back in the dog.
<P>Window - Split Window</P>
This will let you split the window into 4 parts. You can also use the little splitter controls on the upper-right and lower-left of the scrollbars.
Use this feature when viewing extra wide output, such as the edge detector images.
