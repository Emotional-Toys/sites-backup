 HomieGate Install - Main

<HR>


This is the main installation steps for the HomieGate server.
HomieGate is recommended for experienced computer people.
Some of the installation steps are rather complicated.
LAN (WiFi) setup can be very complicated.
<BR>
Advice: There are many things that can be done with HomieGate.
You don't have to get them all working in one evening.
If you run into problems, relax and take a break.
Computers can be frustrating at times.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Hardware Requirements</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Windows PC (the 'Homie Gate Server PC')
<LI>WiFi card (or Access Point) attached to the Server PC.
<DIR>WiFi components should be setup and working already!</DIR>
<LI>Microphone on the Server PC (for testing).
<LI>Speaker on the Server PC (for testing and for regular use to play music)
<LI>Windows XP is recommended.
<BR>Earlier Windows versions will work as well.
<BR>Very old Windows versions (like Win98) are not recommended for use as a full featured HomieGate server (with Voice Recognition)
<LI>The faster the processor the better. Voice recognition is more responsive with a 2GHz+ CPU, but a 500MHz CPU also works acceptably.
<LI>Disk space requirements for HomieGate are minimal. Large hard disk(s) may be used for your music collection.

<A name="VOICE">
<H2>Installing Voice Recognition</H2>

<H3>First check if you need it</H3>
You will need a SAPI 5.x compatible speech recognition and text-to-speech engine installed on your computer.

You can check to see if this already installed by running the 'Control Panel' and selecting 'Speech'.
The 'Speech Properties' Panel should have <b>both</b> a 'Speech Recognition' and 'Text to Speech' tab.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="speech_prop.gif"></CENTER>

If one of these tabs is missing, or you don't have a 'Speech' control panel, then you need to install the Speech SDK.
If you have both, you can skip the next step.

<H3>Download and Install the Speech SDK</H3>
The Speech SDK <A HREF=http://www.microsoft.com/speech/download/sdk51/>version 5.1</A> is available for free download from Microsoft.
This is a large download (68MB).
<BR>
NOTE: do not use the newer beta 6.x SDK.
<BR>
NOTE: you will probably have difficulties on Windows 98 or Windows ME.
Windows XP (or Windows 2000) are recommended for the voice recognition features.

<P>Steps:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Download the "Speech SDK 5.1" : <A HREF=http://download.microsoft.com/download/speechSDK/SDK/5.1/WXP/EN-US/speechsdk51.exe>speechsdk51.exe</A> (68 MB)
<DIR>That is not a typo, it is 68 Mega-Bytes in size.</DIR>
<LI>When downloaded, run the 'speechsdk51.exe' program, and specify a folder (like c:\VSETUP) to unzip the files to.
<LI>Run the SETUP.EXE program in that folder 
<LI>Accept the licence agreement (read it first if you prefer)
<LI>Install the SDK in a different folder (like C:\VSDK)
</UL>
<P></P>
When done you can delete the C:\VSETUP folder and its contents.
<BR>
Optional you can train the speech recognition engine to better understand your voice. I recommend you do that later.

<P></P>
<HR>
<A name="INSTALL">
<H2>Installing HomieGate</H2>

NOTE: you <B>must</B> install HomieGate in the 'C:\Homie' folder on your PC to start with. After the initial installation and testing,
you can move this elsewhere if desired. You must edit paths in the HG.INI file.
<P></P>

<P>Steps:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Download <A HREF="HG_Preview01b.zip">HG_Preview01b.zip</A> (2MB, with config fix and music.g fix)
<LI>Unzip it to the "C:\Homie" folder on your Server PC. Do not install it in another folder.
</UL>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="folder_start.gif"><BR>(what the folder should look like at the start)</CENTER>
<P></P>

<HR>
<H2>Configuring HomieGate (the first time)</H2>
Before running the server, you need to configure it.

<UL>
<LI>Run the configuration tool (C:\Homie\hg_config.exe).
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ss_config.gif"></CENTER>
<LI>Press the "Find My Music" button. This will find the two sample albums ("total 15 tracks from 2 albums". Later you can incorporate your real music collection.
<LI>Press the "Save Changes and Generate Voice Commands" button at the bottom.
HG_config.exe will update the HomieGate server information and close.
</UL>
<P></P>
There are more features of the hg_config.exe program which you can use later.
<P></P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="folder_gen.gif"><BR>(a few generated files added)</CENTER>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Running HomieGate (the server)</H2>

Run the HomieGate server (C:\Homie\hg_server.exe).
<P></P>

You should see the server running:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ss_server.gif"></CENTER>
The listbox gives you status information. A log file (log.out) is also created for debugging.

<P></P>
<HR>
<A name="TEST">
<H2>Testing HomieGate</H2>

For this step we will be using the same PC for both the server and the client.

<BR>
After this initial test, you will use other remote devices ("clients") connected using WiFi.
This includes PDAs, SD panels or robots like AIBO.

<P></P>NOTE: you will need a microphone attached to the PC to say voice commands.
The default "Sound Recording" device is used.
The volume of your microphone must be set correctly.
This is the recording volume (not the system speech recognition volume).
<P></P>
<P>Run the Homie Client</P>
<LI>Run the PC version of the client, (C:\Homie\hg_client.exe)
<LI>It will ask for an IP address. We are using the localhost 127.0.0.1, so you don't have to change anything.
<LI>Press "Connect"
<LI>It should start with the standard client interface in a small window.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ss_pc_client.gif"></CENTER>

<P>Please perform the following tests in the following order:</P>

<P>Test simple .MP3 music playback</P>
<LI>Expand the tree view under "Music"/"Pop"/"Madonna - Like a Prayer".
<LI>Pick any of the .MP3 track and it should play on the PC's speakers. Note: these are short low quality clips, not the full album.
<LI>If that doesn't work, you may not have a .MP3 decoder setup.
<BR>
Try the four Cartman test .WAV files under "Music"/"TestWavs". If WAVs play but not MP3s, please check the <A HREF="install_music.htm#FAQ">Music setup FAQ</A>.

<P>Test microphone and memo record</P>
<LI>Press the "Memo" button
<LI>Say something into the microphone on your PC (talk for a few seconds)
<LI>When done, press the "Done" button (formerly the "Memo" button)
<LI>Scroll down to the "Voice Memos" list and pick the one on the bottom (the files are time stamped in a format: 'yyyy.mm.dd hhmm')
<LI>When you pick that voice memo, you should hear a recording of what you recorded played back on your PC's speaker
<LI>If you don't hear it, your microphone level may be set incorrectly, or your PC sound card may be confused.
Try playing back "Cartmans Todo Note". If you hear it, then check the microphone volume. If you don't hear it there may be something wrong with your sound card setup.

<P>Test voice recognition (the cool features)</P>
<LI>Press the big "Push to Talk" button.
<LI>Ask "What time is it?". Speak clearly into the microphone.
<LI>You should hear the answer, and the big button should change back to "Push to Talk".
<LI>Repeat the process (ie. press the button before you talk) and ask:
<LI>Ask "Why is the sky blue?"
<LI>Ask "What is the first law?"
<LI>Ask "Who invented the internet?"
<LI>Say (in one breath) "Play Music Like a Prayer by Madonna"
<LI>Say "Next song"
<LI>Say "Stop the music"
<LI>There are literally thousands of things you can say or ask.
See the <A HREF="vcmd.htm">What to Say</A> list.
<LI>NOTE: When HomieGate is listening to you, the "Push to Talk" button becomes "Talk Now, push to stop".
Normally you don't need to press the button to stop
Normally if HomieGate understands what you are saying, you don't have to push the button a second time to stop.

<P>What Now ?</P>
<LI>If you have an X10 Firecracker module controlling your home, you may want to try the <A HREF="install_x10.htm">X10 setup</A> now.
Otherwise, you should start installing the client software for WiFi devices you own.
<LI>If you have an AIBO with a WiFi card, you will probably be eager to install the <A HREF="install_aibo.htm">AIBO support</A>
<LI>If you have a hacked SD panel, you should perform the <A HREF="install_panel.htm">SD Panel install</A> since it is the best remote control around.
<LI>PocketPC users should look into the <A HREF="install_pda.htm">PDA install</A> if you have the right hardware.
<LI>Later, you should think about incorporating your music collection sitting on your computer (perhaps in MP3 format).
See the music <A HREF="install_music.htm">music setup</A> page.

<P></P>
If you don't have any of the above, you can stick with the PC based client, but you are really missing out on the coolness of HomieGate.
