 HomieGate - What to Say or Ask (general)
</H1>
</center></td></tr></TABLE>

<HR>


HomieGate tries to interpret your voice commands.
<BR>
For the computer clients (PC, SD Panel, PDA), you should press "Push To Talk" before speaking.
Then speak the command clearly into the microphone.
Optionally you can press the button again when you are done with the command, but this is done for you.
<BR>
For the AIBO client, you should say "AIBO" first or press his back switch.
When the lights start flashing, speak the command clearly into AIBO's ear microphone.
Do not speak too loud.
<BR>

<H3>Reactions</H3>
HomieGate will give several kinds reactions depending on what is hears and how it interprets the voice command.
<BR>
The most common is when it hears something that matches the knowledge base, and it responds directly in the synthesized voice. For example: "why is the sky blue" and the response:
"The sky is blue because of the atmospheric optical effect known as Raleigh scattering."
<BR>
There are special cases that are more elaborate than the first, where the replies are not just fixed. For example: "insult me" (ADULT CONTENT!)

<P></P>
There are music playing specific voice commands, including to customize voice commands to play your specific albums.
<BR>
There are X10 specific voice commands which you can customize.
<P></P>

When run on an AIBO, there are AIBO specific commands that include commands like "Sit Down", questions like "Are you hungry?" and several pre-recorded skits (eg: "act like a mad cow", "do you want a Scooby Snack ?")
<P></P>
The last reaction is when the voice command was not understood.
For a computer client, what it thought it heard is displayed in the status area.
For AIBO, it will play an annoying beep.
<P></P>
<H3>Other Tips</H3>
<LI>The time from when you stop talking until the client starts responding will depend on the speed of your HomieGate Server PC.
This delay is a little longer for AIBO clients.
<LI>Only say what you want. Extra words at the start will interfere. "What time is it" is good. "Umm, what time is it" is bad. "What time is it blah blah" is ok.
<LI>Try speaking in a quiet environment. You don't need to shout, keep a little distance from your mouth to microphone (or AIBO's ear)
<LI>For AIBO: AIBO listens from his left ear

<A name=MUSIC>
<H2>Music Playing</H2>

If you have selected the "My Album names are unique (enough for voice commands)" option in hg_config.exe, then you can use voice commands to start any of your albums.
Then you can use "Next song" (or other general music voice commands) to skip to the next track/song in the album.

<P></P>
Once a track, album or playlist is playing, there are other voice commands for controlling the playback.
<UL>
<LI>"Stop the music" or "Stop playing" or "Be quiet" - will stop the current track, album or playlist
<LI>"Next song" "Skip song" or "Skip this song" - will skip the current song
<LI>"Next track" "Skip track" or "Skip this track" - does the same (skip the current song)
"Previous song" or "Previous track" or "Go back one song" or "Replay that song" - will go back on song
</UL>
