For information on setting up your music collection and/or troubleshooting, please refer to the <A HREF="install_music.htm">Music Install</A> page.
<BR>
This page describes how you use the tree view of the HomieGate client (on a PC, SD display or PDA) to select songs or albums, build and use quick playlists and other features.
<BR>
You can also use voice commands to control playlist playback.
See the <A HREF="vcmd.htm#MUSIC">voice command</A> list for more details on the voice commands.
These voice commands can be used in conjunction with the Client User Interface.
<P></P>
NOTE: For the sake of all discussions regarding music, a track is a song.
Each track/song is a single file on the HomieGate server.

<H2>User Interface - 4 Buttons and a Tree list</H2>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="ss_pc_client.gif"></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI>The "Stop" button above the tree view will stop any currently playing song, playlist or album.
<LI>The "|<<" button will go back one track in the current playlist or album.
<LI>The ">>|" button will go forward one track in the current playlist or album. If you are on the last track of the playlist/album, it will start over from the beginning.
<LI>"Add PL" is a button used to create quick playlists. See instructions below.
<LI>All the rest of the user interface is performed by selecting items in the tree list.

<H2>Direct Playing</H2>

EDITORIAL: I find this is one of the best features of HomieGate. You can have a HomieGate client running within hand's reach, but could be far away from your computer and home stereo.
It is easy to start a song, switch to another song, skip a track you don't like on an album or other immediate response commands.

<H3>Two modes</H3>

The main user interface of the HomieGate client is a Windows tree control.
It can act in one of two modes.
The mode setting is under "Options", "Quick Select in tree".
<BR>
If this option is off, the tree control works exactly like it does in most programs.
You typically double-click on a heading, or click on the small +/- box to expand or contract headings.
<BR>
If this option is on (recommended), the tree control is optimized for single clicks.
You can click on a heading (eg: an album title) and it will expand, and usually unrelated information will contract.
Try out this mode, and I think you will find it easier to use.
If not, turn off the "Quick Select in tree" option and use it like a regular windows tree control.

<H3>Playing a single track</H3>

In the HomieGate client view, expand the "Music" tree node.
Under there you may see a list of music genres (eg: Pop, Rock, Rap).
This will depend on the way your music is organized on the server.
Select the Genre or other heading until you get to the album you like.
Finally click on the track/song name and it should immediately start playing.
<BR>
NOTE: if you select an indivual track while a playlist or album is playing, it will temporarily replace the current track in the playlist (or album).
The rest of the playlist (or album) will resume playing.
If you don't 

<H3>Playing an existing playlist</H3>

In the HomieGate client view, expand the "Play Lists" tree node.
Pick the playlist you want to play.
Newly created playlists will be timestamped.
<BR>TIP:If you decide you like a playlist, you can rename it to something better (but this must be done on the server).

<H3>Playing an album</H3>

In the HomieGate client view, expand the "Albums" tree node.
Pick the album title you want to play. The entire album will playback from start to finish.
<BR>
NOTE: there is no "Genre" categorization of albums, so if you have a lot of music this list can get very long. This will probably be added later.

<H3>While playing a playlist or album</H3>
You can use the "|<<" or ">>|" buttons to skip back or ahead on the playlist.
This goes by entire tracks/songs only.
Press the "Stop" button to stop the playlist.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Creating Play Lists</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Press the "Add PL" button (it will change to "Done")
<LI>Scroll through the "Music" tree and pick the songs you want to play, in the order you desire.
Choose wisely, there is no undo.
<LI>When you are done creating the playlist, press the "Done" button.
<LI>You should now see a new entry at the bottom of the "Play Lists" tree.
<LI>Select that playlist to start playing it immediately.
</UL>

TIP: you can create new playlists even if a current playlist is being played.
<BR>TIP:If you decide you like a playlist, you can rename it to something better (but this must be done on the server).
<BR>TIP:If you want to edit your playlists, you can do so on the server. Playlists are just plain .TXT files (one song/track per line).
