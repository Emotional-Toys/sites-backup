<H2>Architectural Overview</H2>

The main HomieGate server program runs on your desktop PC (the Homie Gate Server).
It is the gateway to your Home PC.
<BR>
Some available features require hardware attached to the Homie Gate Server (eg: Home stereo, X10 home automation).
<P></P>
Remote devices (clients) talk to the Homie Gate Server via WiFi.
You use these devices to control the features of the Homie Gate Server, either through a touch screen or through voice commands.
<BR>
Examples of HomieGate voice commands include "what time is it?", "turn on the light", "play album Ray-of-light by Madonna", "Skip the song", "why is the sky blue?".
<P></P>
For use with AIBO, everything is done through voice commands.
You get AIBO's attention, by saying "AIBO" followed by the HomieGate voice command.
??? REVIEW: update
There are AIBO specific features like, "Are you hot?", "Are you tired?", "Perform the bender monkey speech" (and other skits), "walk forward 1 metre",...
<P></P>
For use with PDAs, there is a simple user interface that you can click directly on the PDA screen.
Everyting is directly accessible, ie. no typing (other than entering the initial IP address of the server).
This is much more convenient for picking songs from albums to play, or building quick play lists, or direct control over X10 devices.
<P></P>
The voice recognition feature is also available on PDAs (when the PDA microphone is adequate quality).
You can also record voice memos and other features.

<H2>Supported Clients (Remote Devices)</H2>

<BR>
The following clients will be supported for the Beta3 release:
<P></P>
<H3>AIBO</H3>
<DIR>
<LI><IMG SRC="../gfx/icon_7.gif"> - ERS-7 AIBO (with built-in WiFi card).
</DIR>
<P></P>
Speak your commands into AIBO's ears.
He will talk back to you and do other things (ie. dance or walk around).
<BR>
This is similar to the old <A HREF="../210/brainbo.htm">BrainBo V1</A>.
Older version of HomieGate (Beta1) supported the ERS-210 and ERS-220. The ERS-2x0 models are not currently supported in the current release.

<P></P>
<H3>CLIE</H3>
Supports the CLIE PalmOS devices with WiFi support (eg: NX/NZ with WL1x0 card, UX or TH series).
Voice recognition and synthesized voice playback supported (NOTE: requires MCA2 for NX/NZ devices).

<P></P>
<H3>Viewsonic Smart Display Panel</H3>
Use microphone and speaker.
Large screen is great for selecting from large music collections.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="panel_ui.jpg"></CENTER>
Same as the PocketPC version.

<P></P>
<H3>Pocket PC</H3>
Any Pocket PC PDA with ARM processor and WiFi card (eg: Toshiba or iPaq).
Small PDA version of user interface.
All the same features as the large panel display.
Depending on device, microphone may be too noisy for good quality voice recognition.
<P></P>

<H3>Local Client (Windows)</H3>
The client software will run on a standard Windows PC as well.
This is typically run on the server PC to test out the interface, but can be used on any other PC (eg: a laptop) with a WiFi card.
<P></P>

<P></P>
