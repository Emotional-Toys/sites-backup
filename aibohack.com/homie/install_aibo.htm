The current AIBO version is very simple.
AIBO will sit there and wait for you to tell it what to do.
A future version will be more elaborate and inco

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Hardware Requirements</H2>
<UL>
<LI>HomieGate Server <A HREF="install.htm">installed, configured and tested</A> previously
<P></P>
<LI>An ERS-210 model AIBO
 <B>OR</B>
<LI>An ERS-220 model AIBO
<P></P>
<LI>A Pink Programmable Memory Stick (AKA "PMS" or RCode stick) - ERA-MS008 or ERA-MS016, $34->$39
<LI>A memory stick reader to install the software (<font color=red>Use only Sony brand stick readers</font>)
<LI>An AIBO LAN Card on the same WiFi network as the HomieGate Server
</UL>
You should be familiar and comfortable with general AIBO WiFi configuration and testing (using 'ping').

If you have never run "AiboScope LIVE!" or "AiboRemote" or the Sony AIBO Navigator,
you should start with those programs before trying HomieGate.
If you have run those programs before, and have a working WLANCONF.TXT file, you are most of the way there.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Installation and Testing</H2>

<P>Installation (on AIBO)</P>
<UL>
<LI>Put an available PMS stick into your computer's stick reader
<LI>Select any folders you see at the root of the stick (usually OPEN-R and CUSTOM) and delete them. Do not format the stick.
<LI>Download the proper RCodePlus runtime for the model of your AIBO.
<UL>
<LI>For the ERS-210: <A HREF="../rcode/RCodePlus252A(210).zip">RCode Plus 2.52 'A' (210)</A>
<LI>For the ERS-220: <A HREF="../rcode/RCodePlus252A(220).zip">RCode Plus 2.52 'A' (220)</A>
</UL>
<LI>Unzip this RCodePlus file to the root of your PMS memory stick.
<LI>Download the HomieGate Test Personality: <A HREF="HG_Aibo01.zip">HG_Aibo01.zip(very small 35KB)</A>
<LI>Unzip that file on top of your RCODE/PMS stick (replacing any files it asks about).
<P></P>
<LI>If necessary, customize the WLANCONF.TXT file on the memory stick to work with your WiFi LAN setup.
If you don't change this, the default will be for a WiFi 'AIBONET' with WEP enabled ('AIBO2' password).
AIBO will be on IP address 10.0.1.100
<LI>Put the stick in AIBO (but don't boot him up yet)
</UL>

<P>Installation (on HomieGate Server)</P>
<UL>
<LI>Run the configuration tool (C:\Homie\hg_config.exe)
<LI>Check the "AIBO (Client #3)" checkbox.
<LI>Change the IP address for your AIBO if necessary (NOTE: be sure you are running .01'A')
<LI>Press the "Save Changes and Generate Voice Commands" button
</UL>

<P>Testing - LAN connection and polling</P>
<UL>
<LI>Be sure your WiFi card is running on the PC (usually the Link light will flash)
<LI>If the HomieGate server is running on the PC, stop it now.
<LI>Put the memory stick inside your AIBO and start it up.
<LI>AIBO will stretch and sit there waiting with no LEDs on.
<LI>Now run the HomieGate server (C:\Homie\hg_server.exe).
<LI>Keep an eye on the third status line in the upper right of the HomieG server dialog.
It should change from "Searching for AIBO" through several messages eventually to "AIBO ready"
<LI>AIBO should stretch again, and his forehead light will turn green.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ss_aibodetect.gif"></CENTER>
<LI>TIP: If AIBO is not found, be sure you can 'ping' the AIBO from your PC
<LI>TIP: if you can ping, but have problems, try closing and restarting the HomieGate Server (hg_server.exe on the PC).
</UL>

<P>Testing - Voice Commands</P>
<UL>
<LI>Before saying any HomieGate voice command, say "AIBO" first (or press his back button). AIBO's lights will start flashing.
<LI>When the lights are flashing, say the phrase (eg: "How old are you?")
<LI>If AIBO/HomieGate doesn't understand, it will beep. Please say "AIBO" again, and then say the phrase again.

<LI>TIP: using the back button is necessay in loud rooms, or if AIBO gets confused.
Press the back button gently so it doesn't make any noise.
<LI>TIP: if you asked AIBO to play music, it will be too loud for him to hear you.
Press his back to give him a new command (like "Stop the Music").
He will mute the stereo to listen to your every word.
</UL>

<P></P>
That's it for setup.
Try some of the long list of <A HREF="vcmd.htm">what to say (voice commands)</A>.
<P></P>
<P>Other Tips</P>
<UL>
<LI>It usually helps to stop the HomieGate Server program (hg_server.exe) when you initially boot up your AIBO.
<LI>Some of the canned AIBO skits are a little 'jerky', but should not harm your AIBO
<LI>Multiple AIBOs are supported. The need to be on separate IP addresses and configured properly with hg_config.exe.
The configuration tool supports two AIBOs, but the server can handle up to four (the architecture can handle even more).
<LI>With multiple AIBOs, try not to talk to them both at the same time. If both are in the same room,
use the back switch to talk to one at a time.
