<LI>You should know what to do by now by using the other PC clients.
The user interface is generally the same, but there are differences.
The tree-view list is similar to the Windows tree control.
You will need to use the stylus for scrolling through long lists of items, or expanding/contracting nodes.
<LI>The little triangles in front of items act like the "+" and "-" boxes under Windows.
Press a triangle or an item with a triangle in front of it and it will expand or contract.
<LI>Pressing an item without a triangle will activate that item (eg: play a Music track, an entire album, activate an X10 device etc)
<P></P>
<LI>The jog dial, page up and page down buttons will navigate through the tree-view list.
<LI>The Back button starts the voice command function (alternatively the 'T' key). Press the back button, and a "Talk Now" alert will pop up.
You have 5 seconds to talk.
Give a HomieGate voice command like, "What time is it?".
When you are done speaking, press the Back button again.
???? repeat test scenario
If you have no luck with voice recognition, try recording a short voice memo (available from the CLIE menu), then play back the created WAV file on your PC.
<BR>
//REVIEW: add more general details
<LI>Hard Button 2 works as a STOP button
<LI>Hard Button 3 works as a NEXT TRACK button (great for rapidly skipping through play lists or albums)
<LI>The CLIE version has a simplied version of PlayList creation.
Under the "Quick PL" menu you first pick "Start". Then select the tracks or albums to add to the playlist.
When complete pick the "End" menu item.
The playlist will start from the beginning.
