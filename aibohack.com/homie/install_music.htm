<H2>Incorporating your own music</H2>

There are a number of tools for ripping audio CDs, finding free music on the Internet, pirating music from the Internet, and so on.
<BR>
These will not be discussed here.
<BR>
I assume if you are reading this you already have a music collection on your computer that you can play through your home stereo (or a really gnarly set of computer speakers).
<P></P>

There are also a variety of tools for organizing and accentuating your music collection. Many require editing of the actual files (eg: mp3 ID3 tags).
<BR>
These will also not be discussed here.

<P></P>
Instead I will explain how *I* organize music and how it integrates into HomieGate.
The approach is very simple and direct.
More elaborate searching, editing and categorization tools can be used and with a little bit of work, they can probably be integrated into the HomieGate mechanism.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>HomieGate and Music - the *RECOMMENDED* way</H2>
Songs (AKA music tracks) are stored in individual files, typically in .WAV, .MP3 or .WMA format.
Songs are organized into separate directories with one directory per album.
The directories are named for the artist and the album name ("{Artist} - {Album}").
Directories are further categorized by a "Genre".

<P></P>
For example:
<pre>
	C:\Homie\Music\Mellow\XTC-Skylarking\01 Summer's Cauldron.mp3
	C:\Homie\Music\Mellow\XTC-Skylarking\02 Grass.mp3
	....
	C:\Homie\Music\Mellow\Zappa, Frank-The Perfect Stranger\01 The Perfect Stranger.mp3
	C:\Homie\Music\Mellow\Zappa, Frank-The Perfect Stranger\02 Naval Aviation in Art_.mp3
	....
	C:\Homie\Music\MVocal\Bowie-ChangesTwo\01 Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197_).mp3
	C:\Homie\Music\MVocal\Bowie-ChangesTwo\02 Oh! You Pretty Things.mp3
	C:\Homie\Music\MVocal\Bowie-ChangesTwo\03 Starman.mp3
	C:\Homie\Music\MVocal\Bowie-ChangesTwo\04 1984.mp3
	....
</pre>

The path to music files is usually:
<pre>
    {Music_Root}\{Genre}\{Artist}-{Album Name}\{track name}.mp3
</pre>
<P>For this example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The root directory for music is C:\Homie\Music.
<LI>The genres (shown here) are "Mellow" and "MVocal". You can use any Genre names you wish.
<LI>I like placing the track number in front of the track name so it sorts correctly.
<LI>Trees and sub-trees are sorted alphabetically so name albums and tracks accordingly.
<LI>File extensions supported are MP3, WAV, WMA and OGG (others can be added).
</UL>
<BR>

NOTE: this is the *RECOMMENDED* way. If you current music collection is significantly different than this, please send me an email with the particulars.
</pre>

<P></P>
The directory structure underneath the root (in this case "C:\Homie\Music") is shown directly on the HomieGate client:

<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ss_client_music.gif"></CENTER>
<P></P>

NOTE: The voice commands are generated by using this information,
if you have selected the "My Album names are unique (enough for voice commands)" option in hg_config.exe.

<P></P>

TIP: Most Audio CD rippers will automatically generate this recommended format by using "CDDB" information.
You many want to adjust the "Genre" for your personal tastes.
How to use specific file rippers is also not discussed here.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Find My Music</H2>

The configuration tool (C:\Homie\hg_config.exe) will search out your music in certain directories.
It will format the necessary data for the graphical tree list.
<BR>
It will (optionally) generate voice commands for your music collection,
int the form "Play Music {Album Title} by {Artist}" or "Play Album {Album Title} by {Artist}"
but only if you have selected the "My Album names are unique (enough for voice commands)" option in hg_config.exe.

<P>Instructions (must be repeated after every change to the files in your music collection</P>
<UL>
<LI>Stop the HomieGate server (hg_server.exe) if it is running
<LI>Run "hg_config.exe"
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ss_config.gif"></CENTER>
<LI>Be sure the "Incorporate My Music" checkbox is checked.
<LI>If necessary, change the "Root(s)" list to point to your music. If you have more than one folder, separate them with '|'.
<LI>Press the "Find My Music" button, and it will report the number of tracks and albums found
<BR>GEEK TIP: you can examine the generated 'hgdata_music.txt' and 'hgdata_albums.txt' files if you want to see what it found.
<P></P>
<LI>Press the "Save Changes and Generate Voice Commands" button. If it works and you have a large music collection, consider yourself lucky.
<P></P>
<LI>If it gives an error ("An error occured when compiling the grammar")
<UL>
<LI>press any key to continue, and press OK in the dialog.
<LI>turn off the "My Album names are unique (enough for voice commands)" checkbox
<LI>press the "Save Changes and Generate Voice Commands" button again - this time it should work.
<BR>With this feature disabled, you can't use voice commands to start albums (but you can still use the tree list user interface).
<BR>NOTE: the grammar error usually occurs because your album names are not unique enough. You can work around that if you so desire. Email me for details.
</UL>
<P></P>
After the Config tool saves the changes and goes away,
<LI>Finally run the HomieGate server again (hg_server.exe)
<LI>Run one of the client programs, and examine/play the new music listings.
</UL>

<H2>Other Topics</H2>

<H3>Multiple Partitions</H3>

If you can't fit all your music into C:\Homie\Music, or don't want to move the files, you can specify one or more 'root's to your music collection.

If you have more than one music directory, separate them with the | (pipe or vertical bar character).
<BR>
For example: "C:\Music|D:\Music|E:\Music"

<P></P>
<H3>Other ways of organizing your music</H3>

If you've spent hours organizing your music collection and have something that is vastly different than the *RECOMMENDED* way, then do not dispair.
The simple batch file and other utilities can easily be adapted or replaced to make almost anything compatible with HomieGate.
The important file is the "hgdata_music.txt" file generated in the Find My Music step.
Examine the format, and you should be able to figure out an easy way to integrate it into your scheme.
If not, send me an email.

<P></P>
<H3>Fancy Hardware</H3>
<P></P>
With the proper hardware setup, HomieGate will support high-end audio cards, including support for DTS, HDCD, AC3/DolbyDigital, and 96/24 WAVs.
<BR>
Since this is a PC based playback solution (media files must be ripped from CD/DVD and stored on your hard drive), DVD-A and SACD formats are not supported/recommended.

<P></P>
<HR>
<A name=FAQ>
<H2>Music Problems / FAQ</H2>

<H3>Q: I can't play back MP3 files, but I can play the test WAVs</H3>

The default HomieGate player uses the MCI player interface.
Some newer audio codecs don't support this (or not directly).
<BR>
You can test to see if your music will work by running MPLAY32.exe (under most versions of Windows). This is an old media player.
<BR>
If this player can play your music, it should work under HomieGate (and vice-versa).

<H3>Q: Where do I find such codecs?</H3>

First I recommend installing the "Direct Show" filter.
This is part of more recent versions of DirectX (eg: DirectX 8 and above I believe).
This will allow many codecs to work with HomieGate (including older MP3 and OGG audio codecs).
<BR>
If you still have problems playing audio files with MPLAY32.exe, then please send me an email.
<BR>
If this seams like a rather excessive upgrade step (or you have a very old PC) please send me an email first.


<H3>Q: What if I don't use .MP3 format for my music files ?</H3>
I use "MP3 music collection" as a general term.
The HomieGate music tools will work for .MP3, .WAV, .WMA and .OGG file extensions.
That assumes you have the proper MCI codec for that file format (see above).

<H3>Q: What if I need a really special player for my music files?</H3>
The default HomieGate music player uses MCI for fast and efficient playing.
If you need a specialized player, it can be written.
Email me with details of your setup.

<H3>Q: Playlists - if I use MusicMatch, can I incorporate my playlists into HomieGate</H3>

Yes. You can copy the playlist files to the C:\Homie\PlayList directory, and give them a .TXT extension.
Many music players use a simple text file (one line for the full path name of each song/track), and this is what HomieGate uses.
HomieGate has other features as well (including having 'short' names instead of the full path name).

<H3>Q: My MP3 ID3 tags are not being recognized</H3>
MP3 ID3 tags are not used by HomieGate.
You can extract MP3 tag information and add them as extra columns in the generated hgdata_music.txt and hgdata_albums.txt if you do desire.

<H3>Q: why does the Madonna "Like a Prayer" album sound so bad?</H3>
It is just a short example to show how a full album can be played.
They are only short clips and low quality (to fall under 'fair use')
<BR>
You will replace this with your music collection.

<H3>Q: what about the other sample .WAV files ?</H3>
Cartman audio clips are from <A HREF=http://www.southparkstudios.com>southparkstudios.com</A>.
