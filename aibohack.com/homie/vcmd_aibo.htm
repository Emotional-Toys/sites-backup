<H2>Aibo Tricks</H2>

Try the following with your AIBO:

<UL>
<LI>"Are you hungry", "Are you tired", "Check battery level"
<LI>"Are you hot", "Check temperature"
<P></P>
<LI>"look left", "the other right"
<LI>"look right", "the other left"
<LI>"look up", "look at me"
<LI>"look down"
<P></P>
<LI>"Sit down", "Sit up"
<LI>"Lie down"
<LI>"Stand up"
<BR>
NOTE: most of the time AIBO should be sitting
<BR>
NOTE: some of the skits will start from a lie down posture. This makes them a little "jumpy".

<P></P>
<LI>"Hello how are you?", "Bonjour come on sa va?"
<LI>"what do you know?"
<LI>"Hello AIBO"
<LI>"how old are you"
<LI>"what is your name?"
<LI>"who is your owner?" (NOTE: you can customize this in 'gsrc\aibo.g')
<LI>"what is your language?", "what is your native tongue?"
<LI>"what is your version?"
<LI>"when is/was your birthday?"
<LI>"who are your friends?"
<LI>"what are you wearing?"
</UL>

<HR>
<H2>Skits / Impressions</H2>

AIBO can do many impressions:
<UL>
<LI>"do you want a scooby snack?"
<LI>"sing the under pants song"
<LI>"sing the cat food song"
<LI>"sing the tiger song"
<P></P>
<LI>"perform the bender attention skit"
<LI>"perform the bender dream skit"
<LI>"perform the bender drunk skit"
<LI>"perform the bender party skit"
<LI>"perform the bender religion skit"
<LI>"perform the bender religion speech"
<LI>"perform the bender other speech"
<LI>"perform the bender monkey speech"
<BR>
NOTE: you can say "do the" instead of "perform the" in the previous skits
<P></P>
<LI>"act like bender"
<LI>"act like scooby doo"
<LI>"act like astro"
<LI>"act like eric cartman"
<LI>"act like a human baby"
<LI>"act like homer simpson"
<LI>"act like a mad cow"
<LI>"act like pikachu"
<LI>"act like kittens"
<LI>"act like a cat"
<LI>"act like a tiger"
<LI>"act like elvis"
<LI>"act like richard nixon"
<BR>
NOTE: you can say "impersonate" instead of "act like" in the previous skits
</UL>

<P></P>
NOTE: HomieGate may have problems playing back longer skits/dances.
<BR>
NOTE: some of the skits will start from a lie down posture. This makes them a little jumpy/jerky.
Keep AIBO on a soft surface.
If you don't like your AIBO jerking around that much, don't make him perform the skits.
