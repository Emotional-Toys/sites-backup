<DIR>DISCLAIMER:
Currently only the FireCracker X10 PC control module is supported.
<BR>
If you have another X10 computer interface module, please send me an email with details.
</DIR>

<BR>
HomieGate will control X10 devices by voice commands or by selecting options from a HomieGate client (in the tree view under 'X10 Devices').
<BR>
NOTE: HomieGate is not a replacement of your existing home automation software, it only provides basic on/off control on demand (ie. no timers, no macros, no automatically turning lights on and off).

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Hardware Requirements</H2>
<UL>
<LI>HomieGate Server <A HREF="install.htm">installed, configured and tested</A>
<LI>An X10 "FireCracker" module (CM17A) connected to a serial port on the PC
<LI>An X10 Transciever module (TM751) set to the house code you want to use (eg: "A"). This also functions as a lamp module (eg: "A1")
<LI>One or more X10 devices in the same house (eg: lamp modules, appliance modules, garage door openers, ...)
<BR>
NOTE: All of these components come in a <A HREF=http://www.x10.com/automation/firecracker.htm>FireCracker starter kit</A> for around $40 USD for people in the USA.
<BR>
NOTE: In future the more powerful Active Home (CM11A/CM12) will be supported.
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Configuration</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Run the configuration program (C:\homie\hg_config.exe)
<LI>Check the "Use X10 (FireCracker)" checkbox
<LI>Set "Com Port" to the COM/Serial port number your FireCracker is attached to
<BR>
NOTE: the Firecracker module has a pass-through, so you can connect other serial devices to the COM port, but they must not be used while HomieGate is running.
<P></P>
<LI>Press the "Edit" button. This will edit the file 'hgdata_x10.txt' (usually in notepad).
<LI>Make any changes to the hgdata_x10.txt file. Save the file and exit the text editor.
<LI>Return to hg_config.exe and press "Save Changes and Generate Voice Commands".
You must do this after every change to 'hgdata_x10.txt' so the voice commands will be available.
<P></P>
<LI>If the server is already running exit it (close box or ESCAPE)
<LI>Start the server now (C:\homie\hg_server.exe) and it will use the new settings.
<P></P>
<LI>Run one of the HomieGate client programs, like the PC or SD Panel or a PDA, and connect to the HomieGate server.
<LI>Test out your new additions by selecting the devices in the tree view under 'X10 Devices'
<LI>Try out the voice commands as well.
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Editing hgdata_x10.txt</H2>
The format is very simple, and described at the top of the file itself.
You can easily add an unlimited number of X10 commands to your HomieGate server by editing X10.TXT
<BR>
I may add more elaborate documentation here later.
If it is not self explanatory, please send me an email.
