<P></P>
<DIR>NOTE: For the original Toshiba e800/e805. Do not use if you have upgraded to Pocket PC 2003 "SE".</DIR>

<P></P>
Normally when your PDA is in regular portrait orientation, the D-Pad buttons will move the cursor around properly.
If the screen is rotated to landscape (left or right handed) or upside-down portrait mode, the D-Pad buttons will not work as expected.

<BR>
Installing the PadRot Hack will correct this problem.
<P></P>
Features:
<UL>
<LI>Adjusts direction pad buttons to work properly with the current screen rotation
<LI>Version 1.2: keeps the jog dial acting like page up/down (not left/right)
<LI>Version 1.2: proper DPAD/ROCKER notifications when rotated
<LI>Optionally: Adjusts app launch buttons to rotate
<LI>Single install, all other adjustments automatic
</UL>

<HR>
<H2>Requirements</H2>
You must have the following:
<UL>
<LI>Toshiba e800 or e805 PDA
<LI>ROM version 1.0108 or 1.0110. Other versions may work.
<LI>An ActiveSync connection for installation
<LI>Previously installed one of the following resolution switchers.
You should be familiar with how the VGA <-> QVGA switching process works.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF=http://home.comcast.net/~swdeveloper>ResFix (2.0)</A> with landscape mode by deez, $10.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.pocketpctools.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewforum&f=61">MyVGA</A> by hugbug and others, free but registration required
<LI>NOTE: PadRot is not needed for regular Portrait mode VGA

<a name="INSTALL">
<H2>Installation</H2>
This is a one-time installation (ie. do it once and forget about it, unless you hard reset your PDA).
You can optionally keep the "install_padrot.exe" program on your PDA for later use. It also serves as an un-install program.
<UL>
<LI>BACKUP YOUR PDA FIRST!
<LI>Download this file: <A HREF="install_padrot.exe">install_padrot.exe</A> [V1.2 13.8 KB], and put it somewhere you will remember (eg: on your PC desktop)
<LI>NOTE: Do not run this program on your PC. It is a Pocket PC program that you must run on your PDA.
<P></P>
<LI>Put your PDA in the cradle connected to your PC.
<LI>Perform the following steps on your PC:
<UL>
<LI>Microsoft ActiveSync should popup and connect [if not check your connections]
<LI>Press the "Explore" button.
<LI>Double click on "My Pocket PC" 
<LI>Double click on the "Temp" folder
<LI>Drag the install_padrot.exe program from your PC (eg: your desktop) to the \Temp folder on the PDA
</UL>
<P></P>
<LI>Perform the following steps on your PDA:
<UL>
<LI>Run "File Explorer" (in Programs) and go to the "\Temp" folder
<LI>Click on the "install_padrot" program
<LI>If successful, it should report "PadRot hack installed OK (version 1.2)"
and "Soft reset to activate". If not, check below for "Special Case #?"
<LI>Optionally you can close that dialog and it will then ask, "Rotate App Launch buttons?". Normally you should answer no. This is the default.
</UL>
<P></P>
<LI>Remove the PDA from the cradle, and press the reset button. After the soft reset the patched driver will be used.
<LI>The easiest way to test this is to run the Pocket Excel program.
Use the Direction pad to scroll around the 2D array of cells.
When the screen is rotated (with ResFix2 or MyVGA) the Direction pad buttons will scroll in the correct direction.

</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
(there is no Special Case#1)

<P></P>
<H3>Special Case#2 - keep program or delete it</H3>
You don't need to keep the install_padrot.exe program around after following the main instructions and rebooting.
If you plan on uninstalling it later, you can keep the program around (perhaps moving it to the "\Windows\Start Menu\Programs" folder).
Otherwise you can delete it from the "\Temp" folder.

<P></P>
<H3>Special Case#3 - uninstall</H3>
If you run the install_padrot.exe program on a PDA that already has the PadRot hack installed, it will ask you if it should uninstall the hack.
<P></P>
To upgrade, you need to run the newer "install_padrot.exe" twice. First uninstall the old version, soft reset and then install the new version (and soft reset again).

<P></P>
<H3>Special Case#4 - programs that chain the keyboard driver</H3>

If there is something already installed in the chain when install_padrot.exe is run, it will report
"Warning: another keyboard driver is installed",
 and ask "Do you want to install on top of it?"
You will normally select "YES", and it will add the padrot hack to the current head of the chain.
This is a safe option, as long as you don't try to uninstall programs installed <b>before</b> the padrot hack.

<P></P>
NOTE: It will also report the DLL name that is currently at the head of the chain
<BR>
NOTE: If you find chaining programs that do not work after you select "YES" in the install, please send me an email.
