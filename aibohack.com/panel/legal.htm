<P></P>
All the contents of this website are either my own creations (including the enabling patch tool, and the PanelShell),
freeware/shareware written by others,
or other files that are legally redistributable.
<P></P>
I have picked a few freeware/shareware programs for "fun packs" which AFAIK allow for redistribution (some like the Grundle tools require paid registration for full features).
Since the Panel platform does not support standard "Active Sync" program installation,
I have avoided freeware/shareware programs that don't permit custom installation.

<P></P>
<H2>COPYRIGHT - technical</H2>

The underlying ROM image is copyrighted material
(by Viewsonic, Microsoft and maybe others).
<BR>
The ROM image comes with the software (or is obtainable from the Viewsonic website) and is licensed for use with the hardware.
I am not distributing this copyrighted material or anything derived from this copyrighted material.
<P></P>
The ROM modification tool itself is freeware (and rather trivial).
The tool's job is to tweek the copyrighted ROM image to enable compatibility with other more general "PDA-like" Windows CE programs.
The format of the ROM image file is documented on the MSDN website (although only minimally).
<BR>
The ROM modification tool is a general purpose tool for performing a few removal and replacements of the FILES section of a ROM image.
Combined with the PanelShell WinCE mini-launcher, this enables a "back-door" for adding and running programs on your Panel.
These are completely my own creations to supplement the base software in a purely additive way.

<P></P>
<HR>
<P></P>
<H2>COPYRIGHT/DMCA</H2>

The creation of this tool falls under "fair use" to make the Panel compatible with existing (PDA-like) programs.
<BR>
The tool is unaware of copy protection mechanisms or encryption of any form.
<BR>
As pointed out, the tool contains no copyrighted material, and no copyrighted material (or material derived from copyrighted material) is distributed with it.
<BR>
The use of this tool for illegal activities is prohibited.
Please respect the copyrights of others!

<P></P>

<H2>Microsoft DLLs and missing WinCE components</H2>
The software provided with the panel is insufficient for a rich PDA experience (IMHO).
My primary goal is to let you write/port WinCE programs to run on the Panel platform.

<P></P>
Some of these missing system components can be obtained legally from various sources, notably the Microsoft Platform builder.
They can be used for your personal evaluation uses.
Please read any licensing terms that may apply.
<P></P>
Redistribution limitations of the Windows CE technology prevent
free distribution of the files that would make your panel
into a fuller "Windows CE PDA".
<BR>
To do this legitimately, the OEMs (in this case Viewsonic) have to do more
work, and probably need to pony
up more money to Microsoft to licence the full "PDA" set of software.
Similarly, Viewsonic would have to publish a legitimate SDK for developing
add-ins to the V110/V150 series.
<P></P>

So bottom line: if you want your panel to be a real PDA, talk to Microsoft or Viewsonic.
<BR>
If you want a hack that enables some things, but in a less refined way, then you came to the right place.
