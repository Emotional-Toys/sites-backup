<DIR>
<B>DIRE WARNING</B>
If you continue, you will be updating your Viewsonic panel with a hacked version of the Viewsonic provided ROM IMAGE.
<BR>
Proceed only at your own risk!
<BR>
Using these hacks may void your warranty on your hardware.
<BR>
Using these hacks may be in violation of your EULA (or your interpretation thereof).
</DIR>

<HR>

<H2>Requirements/What's involved:</H2>
<LI>You will need a Viewsonic V110 or V150 Smart Display Panel (see bottom of page if you have a Philips 150DM)
<LI>You will need the blue USB cable that came with the panel
<LI>You will need to re-install all the LAN and User settings from scratch (so write them down)
<LI>You will need to install a hacked version of the firmware into the Flash memory of the Panel
<LI>The standard Viewsonic software must be installed on your machine. This software is copyrighted by Viewsonic and Microsoft (and perhaps others).
<LI>Assuming you plan on writing your own programs, you should install appropriate Windows CE development tools (many are available for free download from microsoft.com)
<LI>You must understand the risks involved before proceeding.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Installation overview</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Step1) Prepare by writing down all the LAN and user settings
<LI>Step2) RECOMMENDED: Dry run flash upgrade (no hacks involved yet)
<LI>Step3) OPTIONAL: re-enter all the LAN and user settings
<LI>Step4) make sure panel is still working
<P></P>
<LI>Step5) download the patch tool and PanelShell
<LI>Step6) run the patch and flash upgrade (for real this time)
<LI>Step6b) reboot, and now panel runs "PanelShell" instead of the standard MIRA client
<P></P>
<LI>Step7) enter LAN settings and other configuration
<LI>Step8) use MSTSC to copy over additional files
<LI>Step9) OPTIONAL: install Panel FunPack #1 programs
<LI>Step10) go crazy...
</UL>

<P></P>
After everything is installed, you can install the Panel Fun Pack #1 for some starter programs, or do more advanced customization, or start playing with Platform builder.
<P></P>
<DIR><B>Another warning:</B>
In addition to all the risks involved in re-flashing your Panel, your are embarking into a world of very unpolished software.
For example, some system dialogs don't have proper bitmaps, so you may have to deal with something like this:

<H1>Installation (Steps 1 -> 6)</H1>
</center></td></tr> </TABLE>
<HR>
<P></P>

<H2>Step1) Prepare</H2>

<DIR><I>This step is performed on the SD Panel</I></DIR>
Be sure the panel power is plugged in.
Be sure you have the blue USB cable handy (don't plug it in yet).
Writing down all the LAN and user settings that you originally entered into the panel.
You will have to manually enter these once or twice after re-flashing the panel.
<P></P>
Things you should write down:
<UL>
<LI>All User accounts (the computer name, user name, and optional passwords)
<LI>From the Settings dialog, properties of Preferred Networks (under the "Wireless Networks" tab)
<LI>From the Settings dialog, any IP Settings (under the "Advanced" tab)
<LI>Any other panel preferences 
</UL>
If you don't feel you have all the information you had when the panel was originally setup, then please don't continue.
LAN setup can be frustrating if you forget something, that's why I recommend a Dry Run.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Step2) Dry Run</H2>
<DIR><I>This step is performed with both the PC, and the SD Panel</I></DIR>

This is not strictly necessary, but <B>strongly</B> recommended.
During this step you will be running the RDPWizard on the PC
(officially called the "Restore and Update Wizard").
<BR>
The wizard will transfer a ROM image to the panel,
and the panel will then "re-flash" itself, burning the ROM image into the actual ROM.
For the dry-run, we are using the official Viewsonic ROM image, so in theory nothing will change.
It is a good step to perform so you are familiar with the procedure, and how long it takes.
Also, if you want to go back to the original ROM image (ie. remove all hacks), this is what you need to do.

<P></P>
Find the root of your MIRA installation.
This is typically in the folder:
<PRE>

	C:\Program Files\Common Files\Connected Devices\Mira

	(adjust if you main drive is not on C:)
</PRE>

I will call that the "MIRA folder".
Below that folder is what I will call the "airpanel device" folder:

<PRE>
For the V110:

	{MIRA FOLDER} \ViewSonic\airpanel V110 Wireless Smart Display

or for the V150

	{MIRA FOLDER} \ViewSonic\airpanel V150 Wireless Smart Display

</PRE>

<UL>
<LI>Be sure the blue USB cable is not connected, and the Panel should be turned off 
<DIR><I>The following is done on the PC, using a regular keyboard, mouse and display</I></DIR>
<LI>From the MIRA folder, go to the Tools sub-folder, and run the program "RDPWizard.exe"
<DIR><I>?:\Program Files\Common Files\Connected Devices\Mira\<B>Tools\RDPWizard.exe</B></I></DIR>
<LI>This starts the "Restore and Update Wizard". Select "Update my Smart Display to a different version" and press the "Next>" button.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="update_not_restore.jpg"></CENTER>
<P></P>
<LI>The wizard will ask you to "Connect the Cables". Connect the blue USB cable between your PC and the Panel. Press the "Next>" button.
<LI>The wizard will ask you to "Put Your Smart Display in Update Mode".
<P></P>
<DIR><I>The following is done on the Panel</I></DIR>
Follow the instructions (press the recessed reset button on the panel
and immediately press the 3rd button
from the top on the right side of the panel (the "dashboard button")
<LI>The panel will start up in "USB disaster recovery mode". Don't panic, it isn't a disaster. Release the dashboard button.
You should have heard a sound on your PC (for the USB connect),
<LI>Go back to the wizard on the PC, and press "Next>".
<LI>If the wizard reports "Your Smart Display is Not in Update Mode", then something went wrong.
Follow the instructions to get it into Update mode.
If you are having problems the USB device may not be recognized by your PC.
Try rebooting the PC (that helps me sometimes).
<P></P>
<LI>Once everything is connected, the wizard will say "Welcome to the Update Wizard".
There will be a list of (one or more) installable versions.
For the Dry run, pick the official version "1.0.0056.11:English (United States)". Press "Next>".
<LI>This will typically take 30 seconds for the ROM image
to be transfered to the panel (but not re-flashed yet).
Do not run any other PC programs during the transfer.
If it hangs or gives an error, restart this step from the top.
<LI>During this process the wizard on the PC says "Copying Software to Your Smart Display".
The panel will say "Downloading operating system image to FLASH"
After about 30 seconds, the PC should make a sound again (USB disconnect) as the panel starts "re-flashing" itself.

<LI>The PC will say "Restarting your Smart Display".
You should cancel the wizard on the PC right now
while you are waiting.
You don't need it anymore (Cancel + answer Yes when it complains).
<P></P>
<LI>When the panel is in the "re-flashing" process. It will say "Erasing Flash" on the bottom with a progress bar.
Later it will say "Now programming Flash".
It will repeat this Erase/programming process a few times.
<DIR>Do not unplug the panel's power or battery during this process!!!</DIR>
<P></P>

<LI>After about 3 minutes, the re-flashing will be done on the panel,
and it will report "Image Download successful. Booting System" and it will reboot.
<LI>After less than 1 minute (more), you will see the "Welcome" screen just like it was when you first bought the panel.
<LI>Congratulations, you just "re-flashed" your Panel!
<LI>Don't forget to unplug the blue USB cable (you can do this any time after you cancelled the wizard) and keep it handy.
You will need the cable later for when we re-flash <i>for real</i> in Step#6.
</UL>

<P></P>
NOTE: there also is a wireless way of upgrading the flash ROM, but I recommend the blue USB cable for predictability.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Step3) Dry Run - continued</H2>

<DIR><I>This step is performed on the SD Panel</I></DIR>
This is optional, but recommended if you just ran the
RDPWizard for the very first time,
or if it has been a long time since you setup the LAN.
This will refamiliarize <i>you</i> as to the normal setup process.
<P></P>
Your Panel is starting like it did when you bought it.
We are going to use the "Advanced" installation.
<UL>
<LI>From the "Welcome" screen at the end of Step#2, press the "Advanced" button. Then, press the "Next>" button.
<LI>When it gets to "Align Screen", press the "Next" button and perform the alignment.
<LI>From the "Alignment Successful" screen, press "Next>"
<LI>From the "Input Panel" info screen, press "Next>"
<LI>From the "Completing the Setup Wizard" info screen, press "Finish"
<P></P>
You are back at the main Viewsonic MIRA Shell.
<LI>Select "Settings" and the "Wireless Networks" tab
<LI>Fill in any information needed for your WiFi network
<LI>If using specific IP address (and not DHCP), specify that in the "Advanced" tab
<BR>NOTE: if you don't absolutely need DHCP, I recommend hard coded IP addresses for easier setup, and much faster panel boot/connect times.
<LI>Select "OK" for the Settings dialog, and you should eventually get an "Excellent" rating on your Network status.
If the network does not connect, then find out what you did wrong and fix it now.
<LI>Once all this is working, you can select "New..." from the "General" tab of
the Settings dialog and re-enter the user name and computer name for your User accounts.
This is not necessary for the dry run, but you can do it if you want to test out your panel before going further.
</UL>

If successful, you will have a panel exactly the same as it was before we wiped out the settings in Step #2.
This is only a temporary test (it will get wiped out again in Step#6).
You might think this is a waste of time, but it is a good idea to rehearse it now.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Step4) make sure panel is still working</H2>

<DIR><I>This step is performed on the SD Panel</I></DIR>
If something did not work, or you broke the panel,
or you forgot a LAN or user setting, fix it now.
So far you have not done anything out of normal.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Step5) download the patch tool and PanelShell</H2>

<DIR><I>This step is performed on the PC</I></DIR>

<UL>
<LI>Download this ZIP file <A HREF="pp_minhack102a.zip">pp_minhack102a.zip</A> and store it somewhere on your computer.
<LI>Open the airpanel device folder
<DIR><I>?:\Program Files\Common Files\Connected Devices\Mira\ViewSonic\airpanel V??? Wireless Smart Display</I></DIR>
You should see folders named "1.0.0056.11" and "USBNIC".
<LI>Drag the files from the ZIP file to that folder (ie. unzip the contents of the ZIP to that folder).
<LI>If done correctly you should have the new files like "PanelShell.exe" and "install_ppminhack.bat" in that folder,
along with the original folders named "1.0.0056.11" and "USBNIC".
</UL>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="drag_winzip.jpg"></CENTER>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Step6) Run the patch and flash upgrade (for real this time)</H2>

<DIR><I>This step is performed with both the PC, and the SD Panel</I></DIR>

<DIR><B>PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!</B></DIR>

<UL>
<LI>From the airpanel device folder, run the batch file "install_ppmhack.bat".
You can run it from the command line or just double click on it.
<LI>This will: copy the original ROMIMAGE, patch it, and register a new ROMIMAGE type,
<LI>The Registry Editor will pop up asking "Are you sure you want to add ... to the registry?". Answer Yes, and then OK.
<LI>After all this is complete, the batch file will automatically run the RDPWizard for you.
<P></P>
<LI>This time perform the same steps as in the dry run (Step #2),
but we will pick a different ROM image to re-flash ("PanelPets_MinHack:English")

<DIR><HR>Repeated instructions (with minor changes):<BR>
<LI>Be sure the blue USB cable is not connected, and the Panel should be turned off 
<LI>From the "Restore and Update Wizard". Select "Update my Smart Display to a different version" and press the "Next>" button.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="update_not_restore.jpg"></CENTER>
<P></P>
<LI>The wizard will ask you to "Connect the Cables". Connect the blue USB cable between your PC and the Panel. Press the "Next>" button.
<LI>The wizard will ask you to "Put Your Smart Display in Update Mode".
<P></P>
<DIR><I>The following is done on the Panel</I></DIR>
Follow the instructions (press the recessed reset button on the panel
and immediately press the 3rd button
from the top on the right side of the panel (the "dashboard button")
<LI>The panel will start up in "USB disaster recovery mode". Don't panic, it isn't a disaster. Release the dashboard button.

If you are having problems the USB device may not be recognized by your PC.
Try rebooting the PC (that helps me sometimes).
<P></P>
<LI>Once everything is connected, the wizard will say "Welcome to the Update Wizard".
There will be a list of two installable versions.

<BR><B>For the real thing, pick the second one: "PanelPets_MinHack:English (United States)". Press "Next>".</B>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="pick_second.jpg"></CENTER>
<LI>This will typically take 30 seconds for the ROM image
to be transfered to the panel (but not re-flashed yet).
Do not run any other PC programs during the transfer.
If it hangs or gives an error, restart this step from the top.
<LI>During this process the wizard on the PC says "Copying Software to Your Smart Display".

<DIR>Do not unplug the panel's power or battery during this process!!!</DIR>
<P></P>
<HR></DIR>
<LI>After about 3 minutes, the re-flashing will be done on the panel,
and it will report "Image Download successful. Booting System" and it will reboot.
<LI>After it reboots, instead of the normal Viewsonic launcher you know and love, it will start up the PanelShell mini Launcher.
</UL>
<P></P>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="shell1.jpg"> </CENTER>

<P></P>
NOTE: if you have a non-English version of the firmware, you should be able to customize the .BAT file. Please email me if you want to test this configuration.
<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Aside: Panel Shell - RAM and ROM</H2>
The PanelShell program provides a mini program launcher, a mini control panel and other magic.
<BR>
If you press the "Normal" button it will run the standard MIRA shell.
If you press the "MS TSC" button, it will run the Microsoft terminal client, which we need for copying additional files (in Step#8).
If you double click on a program in the listbox, it will run it.
At the bottom of the list are core control panel applets (starting with "CPL").
Most are not all that useful.
<BR>
When a program is launched (or you hit the "OK" button) the PanelShell will minimize, and appear as a thin blue bar at the top of the screen (easy to click on to restore the PanelShell).
If you press the "X" button, it will close the PanelShell.
If you don't have another program running, it will be gone for good, until you press the reset button again.
<P></P>
<DIR><B>NOTE: pressing the reset button will erase all programs and data from RAM (but settings stored in the registry will be saved).
</B></DIR>

<H2>Step7) enter LAN settings and other configuration</H2>

<DIR><I>This step is performed on the SD Panel</I>
<BR>
TIP: For this step, having a USB keyboard attached to the
panel (and maybe a mouse) makes installation much easier.
</DIR>
<P></P>

Please follow these instructions exactly.
All operations in Step#7 happen on the Panel itself.
<UL>
<LI>Press the "Normal" button on PanelShell. This will start up the normal program so you can configure the LAN (similar to Step#3, unless you skipped it).
<BR>
NOTE: the stylus has not yet been calibrated, so hitting the button may be off.
<LI>From the "Welcome" screen, press the "Advanced" button. Then, press the "Next>" button.

<BR>NOTE: if you don't absolutely need DHCP, I recommend hard coded IP addresses for easier setup, and much faster panel boot/connect times.
<LI>Select "OK" for the Settings dialog, and you should eventually get an "Excellent" rating on your Network status.
If the network does not connect fix it before proceeding (hopefully if you did Step#2 and #3, you won't have a problem here)
<LI>Now or later, you can "New..." from the "General" tab of
the Settings dialog and re-enter the user name and computer name for your User accounts.
This is not necessary for us, since we will use the "MS TSC" client instead.
<P></P>
<LI>Once the network is working, press the Panel's off button (wait till it turns off, about 5 or 6 seconds)
<LI>After it is off, press the recessed reset button to reset the panel.
<DIR>
[note: turn off the panel before you reset to be sure registry changes are saved]
</DIR>
<P></P>
<LI>After reset, the Panel will reboot, and the Panel Shell will again be the only thing running.
<LI>This time press the "MS TSC" button on PanelShell
<LI>This is a different MIRA client that has one important feature (the ability to share the Panel's file system with your PC)
<LI>In the "Remote Desktop Connection" dialog, type in the LAN name of your PC under "Computer".
Do not press "Connect" yet (or hit the Enter key)

</UL>

<P></P>
If you see your PC's desktop running on your Panel, congratulations you have opened the back door!

<P></P>
NOTE: the green LED on the top left of the panel does not work during this operation.
The quality of the WiFi signal can be tested by running the "Normal" program (but you can't exit the normal program without resetting the device)
<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Step8) use MSTSC to copy over additional files</H2>

<DIR><I>This step is performed on the panel, but talking to the PC via WiFi</I></DIR>
<BR>
Now, you may wonder what is different from the normal MIRA Shell.
There are a few minor cosmetic differences.
There is a titlebar at the top of the screen (you can turn this off).
There is also a blue bar above that titlebar which you click on to bring the PanelShell back (don't do that now).
<P></P>
To see what is <I>really</I> different
<BR>
Go to "My Computer" and look for a new folder called "Files on WindowsCE".
This is alternatively called "\\tsclient\Files".
<BR>
This is a network folder giving you complete access to the Panel's file store.
Browse that folder, and in particular the "Windows" folder.
While you are connected to your PC using this method,
you can copy files from your PC directly to your Panel's file system.

<DIR><I>What is going on:</I>
<BR>The WindowsCE file system (on the Panel) is exported to the desktop using the WiFi network connection.
It shows up on the PC's Windows XP-Pro desktop as a remote network drive.
Using the standard Remote Desktop feature, you are viewing the Windows XP desktop on the Panel, which is in turn displaying on the WindowsXP-Pro desktop's rendition of the Panel's file system.
</DIR>

This file sharing connection is only available when the "MS TSC" client is running and connected to your PC.
Use this connection to copy programs or data files to the Panel's RAM file system for later use.

<P></P>
NOTES:
<LI>There is only 2MB of space for copying files.
You can adjust this with the System control panel.
Double click "CPL: System (cplmain.cpl)" from the PanelShell listbox and pick the "Memory" tab.
<LI>The PanelShell will also launch programs from the IPSM folder (ROM not RAM).
I have had flakey results storing programs and data in this folder.
If you have better luck with your experiments, please let me know.
<BR>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Step9) OPTIONAL: install Panel FunPack #1 programs</H2>

<DIR><I>This step is performed on the panel, but talking to the PC via WiFi</I></DIR>

<a name=FUNPACK>
The current FunPack (#1) includes:
<UL>
<LI>pnotepad.exe - Pocket Notepad
<LI>gExplore.exe - Grundle Explorer (shareware version, limited)
<LI>gRegEdit.exe - Grundle RegEdit (shareware version, limited)
<LI>registry.exe - Another registry editor
<LI>mspacman - Ms PacMan (shareware)
<LI>reversi - another classic game
</UL>

<P></P>

To install the FunPack:
<UL>
<LI>Connect as you did at the end of Step#8.
<LI>Download this ZIP file <A HREF="pp_funpack1.zip">pp_funpack1.zip</A> and store it somewhere on your computer.
<LI>From "My Computer" on your PC, open the folder called "Files on WindowsCE".
This is alternatively called "\\tsclient\Files".
You should see the root of the WinCE file system.
<LI>Unzip the contents of the pp_funpack1.zip ZIP file to that folder.
This installs most of the programs in the "\Programs" folder on the Panel's RAM based file system.
<LI>You can disconnect the MIRA mode to the PC now if no longer needed.
<LI>On the panel, click on the blue bar at the top to bring the PanelShell back.
Press the 'refresh' button, and the new programs should appear.
<P></P>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="shell3.jpg"> </CENTER>
<LI>Double clicked on a program name to run it.
<LI>You can sometimes juggle more than one program at a time,
but I recommend using one WinCE program at a time.
There is no WinCE task bar to switch between programs.
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Step10) go crazy...</H2>

The procedure for installing your own WinCE programs is much like Step#9.
You copy files to the "\Programs" folder on the WinCE device.
Then press "refresh" and launch them from the PanelShell.
<BR>
Try out other WinCE programs using this proceedure.
If your program crashes, typically you just close it and all is fine.
If your program hangs the system, you are in trouble.
You will then have to reset the device, which wipes out the RAM contents.
You must then re-create the "\Programs" folder and copy over the programs again, but be more careful this time.
<P></P>
Other Suggestions:
<UL>
<LI>Port existing WinCE or PocketPC programs to the Panel
<LI>Find more freeware/shareware WinCE programs that run well on the Panel, and email them to me for FunPack#2.
<LI>Use Platform Builder to build some of the missing system components, and copy them to the Panel (redistribution rights have relaxed a little since this was first written)
<LI>NEW: If you want the Taskbar at the bottom of your screen, install 'explorer.exe' in the "\Windows" folder of the Panel and run it.
Unzip from <A HREF="explorer_wince41.zip">explorer_wince41.zip</A>.
You don't get file exploring, but you will get the taskbar at the bottom which can be used to kill running programs.
The official control panel also works (instead of the minimal one in the PanelShell)

<H2>NEW: Philips DesXcape 150DM owners</H2>
I prefer the Philips 150DM model. It has both a hardware and a software reset.
Use the software reset and you won't lose the contents of RAM uploaded programs.
<P></P>
The instructions are very similar to the above. The batch file and directory names are slightly different.
The USB cabling is slightly different (you need the docking station).
You should be able to figure it out (if not, you probably shouldn't be mucking around with your panel).
<BR>
The DesXcape 150DM specific installation files are here
<A HREF="ppmin_homie_150DM.zip">ppmin_homie_150DM.zip</A>.
Also includes a version of the HomieGate client.
