Here is an older writeup using the Viewsonic panel as a PDA.

<HR>
The heart of your display panel is a pretty good Windows CE PDA.
<P></P>
The hardware capabilities (V150):
<UL>
<LI>400MHz XScale (ARM) processor
<LI>32MB ROM (over 20MB free)
<LI>64MB RAM (over 40MB free when MIRA not running)
<LI>1024x768 x 16bit color display
<LI>Touch screen / Stylus input
<LI>Two USB ports
<LI>PCMCIA slot
<LI>Microphone and speaker
<LI>Good battery life
</UL>

<P></P>
The software has much of what is needed:
<UL>
<LI>WindowsCE 4.1 core software (not a full PDA version)
<LI>Viewsonic MiraShell program (the one you are used to)
<LI>Microsoft provided MIRA shell (with more/different features)
<LI>Control panel and other standard WindowsCE features
<LI>some USB drivers, PCMCIA drivers, printer drivers (lots of things underexploited)
</UL>

But Viewsonic thinks of their Smart Display products as a closed system,
where you can't add you own software.

<HR>
<H2>One Small Hack Later...</H2>
After the minimal enabling hack, many things are possible:

<P></P>
<IMG SRC="photo_panelce1.jpg"><BR>

<P></P>
NOTE: the MIRA program (Remote Desktop Client) is running along with other WinCE programs.
p
<P></P>

<IMG SRC="ss_panelce_bottom.jpg"><BR>

<P></P>
Unfortunately the version of Windows CE 4.1 (AKA Windows CE .NET) that comes with the Panel is trimmed down to handle the Remote Desktop client features, and not much else.
As a result you only have a partial WinCE (PDA) device.
You can supplement it with other WinCE programs (eg: an ancient version of Reversi).
<P></P>
<HR>

BTW: Viewsonic did sell a <A HREF=http://www.viewsonic.com/products/superpda_viewpad100.htm>Super-PDA</A>,
but it is now discontinued (and had a slower CPU and small screen).

<P></P>

Disclaimer:<BR>
For those people who own a PDA or Tablet PC, you may consider these features to be rather ordinary.
<BR>

The challenging part is hacking the Smart Display Panel to do similar things,
whether practical or not ;-)

<H1>Day2: Multiple Mira Clients</H1>
</center></td></tr> </TABLE>
<HR>

The normal use of a Smart Display is as a "Remote Desktop Client"
<BR>
The ViewSonic developers have created their own MIRA client with setup options and other things.
This is what you are familar with if you've used a V110 or V150.

<HR>
<H2>SideBar: Customizing ViewSonic's MiraShell</H2>

I didn't like the layout of the default shell, but like many things it can be tweeked.
<BR>
Many more things are customizable, but the font sizes were the big problem for me.

<P></P>
For example (actual WinCE screenshot):<BR>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="tweeked_ui1.jpg"> </CENTER>
<P></P>
There are other hidden goodies here as well (eg: application add-ins).
I haven't figured out how to tweek the icons yet.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Alternative Client</H2>

You normally can only have one of the ViewSonic's MiraShell programs running at a time (that's all you see).
With the Super-PDA hack, you can decide what programs to run, and when.
<P></P>
I prefer to use the Microsoft Terminal Services client (mstsc.exe).
It has a few additional customization features not normally available (for example):<BR>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="option1.jpg">
</CENTER>

You can "Show contents of windows while dragging" and it works pretty well.
<BR>
If you have installed the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client on another computer (Eg: Windows 95, 98, ME NT, 2K, XP, and even the Mac), you have an idea of what the Microsoft client looks like.
<P></P>

<HR>
<H2>Different clients/Multiple clients (on the same panel)</H2>

With the Super-PDA hack, you can decide what programs to run, and when.
You can run multiple clients at the same time (attached to different computers).
You just need to switch (using the WinCE taskbar) between different clients to switch between desktop computers.
With the normal Viewsonic shell, you need to disconnect from one, then reconnect to the other.

<P></P>
NOTE: This is not earth-shaking.
You can easily have multiple client sessions running on a laptop or other computer that runs the Remote Desktop Client program (Win95 and up, WinCE, Mac or Linux).
Doing it on the closed system Viewsonic panel is new and cool.

<P></P>
NOTE: there are several ways of performing multi-tasking. The easiest is to have the WinCE taskbar "auto-hide" and the Windows XP-Pro taskbar normal.
When running programs on the desktop (Windows XP-Pro), you have the entire screen except for the very bottom of the panel.
To pop up the WinCE taskbar, you just click the very bottom of the screen.
For the screen shot below, I expanded both taskbars for illustration (you can auto-hide one or both).

<HR>
<H2>Multi-Tasking : Many things in one Panel</H2>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="busy.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P></P>
There are many things going on here:
<LI>There are two separate MIRA clients running on the Panel (one is shown, the other is minimized)
<LI>The ViewSonic MIRA shell (minimized) coexists with the Microsoft shell (maximized)
<LI>When the Microsoft shell/client is running, it has a cute little title bar on the top of the screen ("bmgm24"). You can turn this off.
<LI>There are two taskbars in this case.
The bottom one is the WinCE taskbar (switching between apps on the panel).
The other one is from the MIRA session (and is the taskbar of Windows XP-Pro running on the connected desktop)
<LI>The blue background, Command Prompt and Explorer tree view are running on the desktop computer (ie. any old Windows XP-Pro program)
<LI>The "Mini Registry Viewer" program is a WinCE program running directly on the Panel (and temporarily on top of the MIRA client)
<P></P>

In the file view of the above screenshot.
The WindowsCE file system (on the Panel) is exported to the desktop (via WiFi) as a remote network drive, and is displayed on the WindowsXP-Pro desktop as a normal folder.
The graphics rendition of that folder is transmitted to the panel and show graphically using the MIRA client.
<BR>
So you can use Windows XP tools (eg: compilers, editors) to modify WindowsCE programs/files - without touching the keyboard or mouse of your Windows XP computer.
