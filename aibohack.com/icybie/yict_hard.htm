This page is for people who want to customize ICybie behavior logic.
You should already be familar with the <A HREF="yict_easy.htm">Easy to use</A> YICT features.

<P></P>

<H2>Customization Options - General</H2>

<H3>Stretch Legs</H3>
You can set how often ICybie "stretches" on bootup.

<P></P>
<H3>Mood Swings</H3>
You can set the main mood influences.
This is advanced and not well documented.
You can read a little more about ICybie's <A HREF="moods.htm">mood logic here.</A>

<P></P>
<H3>Posture</H3>
The YICT personalities have an improved posture selection logic,
but it is still limited by the base personality.

<P></P>
<H3>Preview Sounds</H3>
This lets you preview the custom sounds.

<H2>Behavior Logic</H2>

This is where the real power of YICT comes in.
You can tweek or significantly redesign the existing personality of your ICybie.

<BR>
The user interface for changing the Personality is very simple.
You click on a "Condition" in the first listbox.
On the second listbox it shows the current reaction to that condition.
Some conditions can support zero or many actions, picked at random.
Other conditions only let you pick one action.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Other Tips</H2>
<LI>You can use the <A HREF="icview2.htm">ICView2 utility</a> to preview the 200+ built in motions on your PC to help decide which motions to use. This is only a rough approximation of motion playback.
<LI>When trying out a cartridge inside ICybie, be sure the cartridge is firmly inserted all the way in.
During bootup (be sure the battery door is closed), his eyes should turn red, and then immediately turn green (waiting for you to press his head).
If not, try re-inserting the cartridge.
<P></P>
<LI>NOTE for SIC owners: If you have an old .ic0 program installed inside your ICybie be sure to install "restore.ic0" first (otherwise the cartridge will not boot)
<LI>NOTE for SIC owners: be sure to use the "-s" flag with sicburn for faster cartridge downloads, or use "Save and Transfer" feature.
<P></P>
<LI>Testing the influences on mood can be difficult. The mood logic is the same as the original personality
(ie. he will change moods at the drop of a hat, you can't tweek that,
but you can totally change what he does in reaction to the moods)
<LI>The "(stand)" moods only work for Happy/Hyper and only if the dog is not in "Stay" mode (button 7 on the remote)
<LI>You can reassign <i>any and all</i> of the performances used in ICybie, but the underlying features are still there.
For example, you can reassign the "Remote 4" reaction - which is normally pushup before entering trick mode.
After your customized reaction, he will still go into Trick mode (that part you can't change)
<LI>experiment with the "Advanced" conditions or the unlabeled actions as you see fit
