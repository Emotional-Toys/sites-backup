<P></P>
<H2>Requirements</H2>

You MUST:
<UL>
<LI>Have a working Super ICybie (ie. working serial port)
<LI>Have a working cartridge
<LI>Have a Windows PC with an available COM port
<LI>Have already used YICT!
<LI>Have some experience with the "C" programming language
<LI>Be interested in writing low level code for your dog.
<LI>Be willing to live with an incomplete SDK
<LI>NOTE: A backup ICybie is recommended (in case something breaks on the SIC)
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Major Caveats</H2>
Read the main README.TXT for a list of features that are working and those that are not.
<BR>
The major incomplete or missing pieces include:
<BR>
1) a real servo control loop (the current version is lame)
<BR>
2) full action playback (the current version does legs and sounds only; no head/neck/mouth/tail or LEDs)
<BR>
3) lots of little things (eg: tilt handling/recovery, clap detect, ...)
<BR>
4) no sample personality (things haven't evolved that far).
<BR>
5) crashes from time to time (be prepared to use that reset button!)

<P></P>
If you are interested in writing personalities, the current ICSDK will not help you. You should use YICT instead.
If you don't know what YICT is, or haven't tried it yet, then you should not
be using the ICSDK.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Things you can do</H2>
Things you *can* do with the ICSDK in its current state:
<UL>
<LI>Play around with any of the low level services/hardware. See list of working things in main README.TXT, plus all the routines in \INC\IC_*.H
<LI>Improve the servo control loop so motion playback isn't so sloppy. See the the 'test0' sample.
<LI>Help finish up the missing features for the first full release
<LI>Contribute new code to ICLib2 (the ICSDK runtime library)
<LI>Contribute new samples, or enhance the existing ones
<LI>Play back the standard actions (see the 'A' and 'a' commands in the 'test1' sample).
Playback is incomplete and sloppy and can jam - but it can be funny too.
<LI>Play around with sound playback (eg: adding your own tone generator).
See the 'sine' sample
<LI>all sorts of IR transmit and receive options.
See the 'test0' sample for IR obstacle detection, or the 'irprobe' sample for even lower level IR signal detection.
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Installation and use</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Download this file <A HREF="icsdk2_alpha01.zip">icsdk2_alpha01.zip</A> (1.8MB) and unzip to a new directory on your Windows PC machine ("C:\ICSDK" recommended)
<LI>Read the main README.TXT file (C:\ICSDK\README.TXT), and the samples readme file (C:\ICSDK\SAMPLES\README.TXT).
<LI>If you want to read, understand or modify the library code, read the library readme file (C:\ICSDK\LIBSRC\README.TXT) as well as the implementation notes (C:\ICSDK\NOTES\*.TXT).
<LI>The samples are much easier to read and understand than the library code itself.
</UL>

<P></P>
To build any of the samples, just go to that directory and type "m" to build and "t" to upload and run (using sicburn).

<pre>
    cd \icsdk\samples\hello
    m
    t

</pre>

<P></P>
To re-build the library:
<pre>
    cd \icsdk\libsrc
    m

</pre>
You can type "m clean" to remove any generated files for a clean build.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Anything missing</H2>

Documentation is intentional minimal and focusing on the essentials.
The audience for the ICSDK is for people who will spend time poking around with the existing source, and already have a reasonable amount of programming experience (ie. not for newbies).
<P></P>

Due to lack of interest, this is essentially "abandon-ware" with no planned future improvements.
All the available source code is in the release itself (see libsrc and binsrc).
