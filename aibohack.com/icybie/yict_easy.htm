The first time you run YICT, you will probably want to use it
to load an existing personality, optionally tweek a few settings,
and then burn it to a cartridge using ICBURN or SICBURN.
The following gives you a short overview of how to do this.

<P></P>
<HR>

<H2>Required Hardware/Software:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>A standard ICybie (Super ICybie is optional)
<LI>A working cartridge (not a blank one)
<LI>Ability to download software to a cartridge (either with the SilverLit downloader or 'sicburn')
<LI><A HREF="index.html#IMAGES">YICT202 software release</A>
<P></P>
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Starting up</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Download this file <A HREF="yict202.zip">yict202.zip</A> (1.7MB)
<LI>Unzip to your computer (into a unique folder, such as "C:\YICT")
<LI>Run the program YICT202.exe
<LI>The first time you run YICT202, it will give you a list of the predefined personalities.
Pick one.
<LI>You will create you own custom personality (eg: MyScooby). This is the personality you will tweek/customize.
</UL>
<P></P>

<H2>Easy Tweeks</H2>

<P></P>
Before saving the personality to a cartridge, you may want to change some of the easy settings.
Most of the basic personality is defined for you.
<BR>
Here are some basic suggestions:
<UL>
<LI>If you do not have a walk-up charger, check the "Disable WUC" option.
Normally ICybie will look for the charger when the battery is low. This disabled the feature.
<LI>If you don't want to hear ICybie, check the "Mute at start" option and he will remain quiet.
You can un-mute him later using the remote control.
<LI>If you like the wagging behavior when ICybie is charging himself on the walk-up charger, change the "Wag on charger" time to your preference.
</UL>

<HR>
<H2>Saving to Cartridge</H2>

Once you are ready to try out the personality, you need to write it to a working cartridge.
<BR>
There are three options:
<UL>
<LI>If you have a SilverLit Downloader attached to your parallel port,
press the middle button "Save and Transfer ICBURN".
<BR>
YICT will run the ICBURN program to burn to the cartridge using the parallel port.
<LI>If you have a Super ICybie attached to the serial port (usually COM1), 
press the last button "Save and Transfer SICBURN".
<BR>
YICT will run the SICBURN program to burn to the cartridge using the serial port.
<BR>
NOTE: if you have a want to change the arguments to ICBURN or SICBURN
(for example to change the COM port),
edit the YICT.INI file to specify additional arguments.
<P></P>
<LI>If you have a SilverLit Downloader and want to use the SilverLit Downloader.exe program (P3 or P4 version),
press the first first button "Save to Image Files".
<BR>
Then load the newly created/updated .BIN files into the Downloader.exe program and write to the cartridge as usual.
<BR>
NOTE: you must download these programs from the SilverLit site or the BBS.
</UL>

If you have problems with the ICBURN or SICBURN utilities, I recommend trying the SilverLit Downloader.exe option.

<H2>Import Behavior</H2>

The ICybie's personality has three parts:
<LI>The custom sounds that define the personality (eg: Scooby Doo has a lot to say about Scooby snacks)
<LI>The behavior logic (imported from an .icb file)
<LI>Other tweeks that you can easily customize for your ICybie (see above)
<P></P>
Most personalities come with the zCybie2 (Z/2) behavior logic.
This is the a very active, varied and crowd pleasing personality.
<P></P>
You can use the new "Import Behavior" functionality to import other behavior from .icb files.
There are several .icb files provided, most from the previous release (YICT 201).
In future, people may post other .icb files for other custom personalities.
<P></P>
<HR>

For more advanced features, please see the
<A HREF="yict_hard.htm">YICT Advanced operations</A>
that describes how to customize the behavior logic.
