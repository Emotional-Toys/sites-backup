    <H1>NOT FOR CHILDREN!</H1>
<BR>
    You must be 18 years of age or older to play the ICybie Exorcist Game!
<BR>
    Contains foul language, and a rather silly game.
<BR>
    Use at your own risk - can be a little rough on your ICybie.

</CENTER>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Overview</H2>

<H2>Required Hardware/Software:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>An ICybie
<LI>A working cartridge (not a blank one)
<LI>Downloader or Super ICybie for downloading the Exorcist personality the cartridge
</UL>

<P></P>
<H2>Installation Instructions</H2>

You should be familar with how to download personalities to a cartridge.

<UL>
<LI>Download this file: <A HREF="exorcist10.zip">exorcist10.zip</A>
<LI>Unzip to your computer. It will create two files: "exorcist-l.bin" and "exorcist-h.bin"
<LI>Download (AKA "Burn") that image to a cartridge as you have done with other personalities.
<LI>When done, you can insert the cartridge into your ICybie, power him up, and run the cartridge program
</UL>

<P></P>
NOTE: I've had problems with my ICybie crashing before it warms up. If you are having problems, plug in the battery, wait a few minutes and then press his reset button to start the new game.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Using it - starting</H2>

To get your ICybie started, press his head.
You ICybie starts out in good temper, with his eyes flashing green.
Press his head, and he will say several nice things and skits.
(If you like him this way, don't press his back button).

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Using it - let the devil in</H2>

When ICybie is in a good temper, with his eyes flashing green, press his back button to let the devil in.

<P></P>
After pressing his back button, you now have a possesed ICybie.
<P></P>

He will flail on the floor saying all sorts of nasty things.
You can put him back on his feet, but he may fall over later.

<P></P>

You must exorcise the evil spirits by interacting with the possesed hound from hell.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Using it - how rude can it get ?</H2>

When your dog is healthy and in good temper, he will flash green eyes, otherwise there are three states of possession:
<UL>
<LI>Mildly Possessed (flashing red and green eyes)
<LI>Possessed (flashing red and yellow eyes)
<LI>Really Possessed (flashing red eyes) - ADULT CONTENT
</UL>
When the devil takes over your dog he will be "Normally possessed".
If you do the right things, he will become "Mildly Possessed" and eventually free of evil demons.
If you do the wrong things, he will become "Really Possessed" and even more vile.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Using it - exorcising</H2>

<P></P>
When ICybie is sitting there with flashing eyes, you can try to exorcise the demons.
<P></P>
You can do one of six things, by using the standard ICybie Remote:
<UL>
<LI>Button 1 - "Be gone" incantation
<LI>Button 2 - "The power of Christ" incantation
<LI>Button 3 - "Holy Lord" incantation
<LI>Button 4 - splash a little holy water on him
<LI>Button 5 - "majestic Christ" prayer
<LI>Button 6 - another prayer
</UL>
If you don't have a remote handy, you can press his head to pick one of the first 3 at random, or his back to pick on of the last three at random.
<P><P>
If you do the right thing, it will hurt the devil inside your dog and it will cry out "it burns", and become less possessed.
If you do the wrong thing, he will more possessed and swear at you some more.

<P><P>
If you succeed, your dog will be back to normal (flashing green eyes), and start saying those cute things again (a different form of possession).
You may have to help him back up on his feet after the ordeal.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Using it - voice commands</H2>
Voice commands also work. If you recorded the standard voice commands, you can use the first six standard phrases ("take a bow", "sit down", "good boy", "trick", "bad dog", "icybie") and they will act like the 6 remote buttons listed above.
<P></P>
For a more realistic experience, take out the cartridge and boot the normal built-in ICybie personality.
Erase the old voice commands (#10+#9+Large+#9+Large) and record 6 new phrases for buttons 1->6 (button #11 + normal voice recording - see instruction manual).
You need to record all eight voice commands, so you can record anything for buttons 7 and 8. When done recording, put the cartridge back in and start the Exorcist personality.

<P></P>

Suggestions for voice commands you can record yourself:
<UL>
<LI>Button 1 - "Be gone"
<LI>Button 2 - "power of Christ"
<LI>Button 3 - "Holy Lord"
<LI>Button 4 - "Holy Water"
<LI>Button 5 - "Majestic Christ"
<LI>Button 6 - "Save me"
<P></P>
<LI>Button 7 - "Stay" (not used for Exorcist game, but something must be recorded)
<LI>Button 8 - "Guard" (not used for Exorcist game, but something must be recorded)
</UL>
