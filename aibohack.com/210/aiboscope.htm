ERS-2x0 AiboScope (LIVE!)
</H1>
</center></td></tr></TABLE>

<HR>


AiboScope is used in conjunction with a <A HREF="lifeplus.htm">"Life Plus"</A> memory stick. This allows you to monitor your AIBO from your computer while AIBO is walking around the room and living its life.
<P></P>
Aibo Scope only works with an ERS-210 or ERS-220 AIBO hooked up to your PC computer via the Wireless LAN card.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Overview</H2>

There are several key features of AiboScope:
<UL>
<LI>Works with "Life Plus" and your own AIBO's personality (AiboLife 1 Plus, AiboLife 2 Plus, Explorer Plus or Recognition Plus)
<LI>Show a "live" picture of what AIBO is seeing with his camera
<LI><font color=red>NEW: </font>Optionally plays live sound from what your AIBO is hearing on your PC's speakers
<LI>Show a radar plot of what AIBO is seeing
<LI>Show 8 smaller pictures showing what colors are detected
<LI>Display a log of the voice commands AIBO has heard
<LI>Display the top 10 voice command matches
<LI>Show a log of all the input events influencing AIBO
<LI>With "AiboCam" - you to create an .AVI clip of the camera data coming from AIBO
</UL>

<P></P>
The Main Screen: (screen shots are a little out of date)
<BR><center><IMG SRC="ss_asl1.gif"></center><BR>
NOTE: the actual camera image is crisper than the fuzzy image in the screenshot.

<H2>Features in Detail</H2>
<H3>Camera</H3>
At the upper left is the video camera feed from AIBO's nose camera.
At the current rate, it updates several frames per second.
<P></P>
There is a separate utility (AiboCam) that can capture the video directly (without the overhead of AiboScope) and save it as a AVI file.

<H3>Color Detection</H3>
The 8 smaller images (4x2) to the right of the camera image show the color detection of AIBO. There is one image for each of the 8 color detection settings.
The images are shown in appropriate colors (ie. there is both a Red and Pink that get interpreted as the "Ball").
To the right is the legend.

<H3>The Radar Screens</H3>
When AIBO detects interesting things with his camera, IR range sensor or ears, it has a rough idea of where those things are in 3D relative to his head.
The radar screens try to show those 3D positions in two 2D plots.

<BR><center><IMG SRC="ss_asl2.gif"></center><BR>
Explanation: The top radar is trying to show an AIBO eye's view of what is going on. AIBO's nose is looking into the page.
Most of the interesting things (BALL color, FAVorite color, something moving andobstacle) are right in front and a little below his nose.
<BR>
The bottom radar view is from the top looking down at AIBO (his nose is facing up)
<BR>
This user interface needs more improvement (and some cute graphics).
<P></P>
Interesting things that AIBO can detect with a 3D position are:
<UL>
<LI>BALL color, FAV color, UNFAV (hated) color
<LI>OBJect in his path, OBSTacle in his path
<LI>HAND in his face, WALL, CLIFF and BORDer
<LI>MOVing object in front of his face
<LI>VOICE - where the last voice command was heard from
<LI>others to be documented
</UL>

<P></P>
<H3>Moods</H3>
Changes in moods are recorded here. Each mood (emotion or instinct) has 5 levels (Very Low, Low, Med, High, Very High). The last detected mood value is recorded here.
It is these changes that cause changes in behavior.

<P></P>
<H3>Voice Cmds log</H3>
This is a list of all the voice commands detected by AIBO.
The most recently heard voice command is at the bottom.
<DIR>English is supported for all sticks</DIR>
<DIR>French, German and Japanese are supported for Aibo Life 1 only</DIR>

<P></P>
<H3>Voice Dictionary Top Ten</H3>
When AIBO hears your voice, this list is filled with the top ten voice dictionary matches.
The list is in order of best match (top of list) to worst match (bottom of list) .
Unlike the "Voice Cmds" list which gives you a history of commands heard, this is only valid for the last heard voice.
<P></P>
If you look at the example above, the last voice command heard (and recorded in the "Voice Cmds" log was "VCmd#38 Fetch/Find the ball".
In the "Voice Dictionary Top 10" list, the best match was "Fetch the Ball". The second best match was a different version of "Fetch the Ball" (there are multiple ways AIBO is trained to detect each phrase).
The third on the list is a version of "Shake Paw".

<DIR>IMHO this is a very useful, but hidden feature. Watching this display while talking to your AIBO gives a lot of insight into how the voice recognition works.</DIR>

<P></P>
<H3>Event Log</H3>
At the very bottom is the Event log (for "Semantic Input Events").
These have a textual list of events detected by AIBO.
These are the same Semantic Input Events that drive the behavior of AIBO.
<BR>
Most of the event data is shown elsewhere on the AiboScope display.
Reading this log will tell you the order things happened,
give you other events info (like LOUD sounds or RHYTHMic dance music)
and adds to your insight into what is happening inside of AIBO's brain.

<TABLE width=100% border=1 bgcolor="#C0C0C0"><tr><td><center>
<H1>Installation</H1>
</center></td></tr> </TABLE>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI>Follow the <A HREF="lifeplus.htm">installation instructions</A> for one of the three "Life Plus" you wish to use. Be sure to configure the WLANCONF.TXT file.
<LI>You must know your AIBO's IP address (usually 10.0.1.100)
<P></P>
<LI>Download <A HREF="AiboScope252.zip">AiboScope252.zip</A>
<LI>Unzip the AiboScope252.zip onto your PC (any directory you wish).
<P></P>
<LI>Be sure your PC LAN card is running, then put the stick in your AIBO and boot him up.
<LI>Try pinging your AIBO ("ping 10.0.1.100"). If that doesn't work, fix your net connection, or try rebooting your AIBO.
<P></P>
<LI>Run the AiboScope program on your PC.
<LI>When prompted, enter the IP address of your AIBO.
<LI>If connected, you should see the camera data and other telemetry displayed on the screen.
<LI>If it fails, try pinging your AIBO.
<P></P>
<LI>Sit back watch while you interact with you AIBO (there is little to change in the AiboScope screen).
<BR>WARNING: When AIBO is walking around sending data with the LAN card, the dog heats up faster and the battery does not last as long (compared to a normal ERS-2x0).
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>AiboCam</H2>

<BR><center><IMG SRC="ss_aslcam.gif"></center><BR>

AiboCam takes the pictures from AIBO, and saves them as a .AVI file.
AiboCam will also test the net connection, and give a full screen preview of the camera data.
The user interface and options are obvious, I hope.
