<H3>DHS - what is it?</H3>
ERS-210 AIBOs may suffer from "DHS" - Droppy Head Syndrome.
It is usually caused by a "slip clutch" in the neck servo slipping.
<BR>
The clear signs of DHS are (1) AIBO's head will not lift up and/or (2) When AIBO is trying to lift his head, a whirring sound is heard.
<BR>
If your AIBO gets his neck caught somewhere, and it tries to move his neck, it may increase the chances of "DHS".
"DHS" may occur after your AIBO is older (typically after 6 months of use or longer), but can occur a lot sooner.
<P></P>
The ERS-220 AIBOs can get "DHS", but not as quickly.
The ERS-220 head is lighter and more balanced (ie. no ears), which reduces the stress on the neck.
The ERS-31x series do not have the "DHS" problem (they use different servos in the up down parts of the neck).
<P></P>
<H3>How to get someone else to fix it</H3>
If your AIBO is under warranty or extended warranty - send it to Sony for the repair.
The "repair" is actually a head replacement.
<BR>
The "repair" out of warranty costs around $500.
Alternatively you can buy a new head from the Sony parts department for around $350 (unless your AIBO has a rare color) and install it yourself.
<BR>
The problem has not been completely fixed by Sony.
There is variation in the manufacture of the "clutch" mechanisms, so not all AIBOs are created equal (at least in terms of neck strength).
<P></P>

<H3>How to fix it yourself</H3>

<DIR>NOTE: these instructions are a little out-of-date. Please refer to the newer version being prepared by X-Dog (the world expert in DHS repair)
</DIR>

If you want to try to fix it yourself, here are some instructions to make the neck repair yourself.
It is very delicate work, and there is a good chance you could break something if you are not careful.
Performing the operation will void any warranty
[BUT:  you should not perform this operation if your AIBO is under warranty -- see above]
<BR>
I only recommend this procedure if you are used to taking small things apart, and are pretty good at putting them <i>back together</i> in working order.

<P></P>
Friedrich Rockenbauer wrote the original version.
I have edited it and updated it with comments from other people, and my own experiences.

<HR>

1) Remove the 8 screws marked below
<BR>
<img src="dhs_fix_79.jpg">

<P></P>
2) Pull off the bottom assembly, inserting a screw driver in
direction of the arrow below.
Be careful not to pull it apart too far or you will break the wiring.
<P></P>

<img src="dhs_fix_81.jpg">

<P></P>
3) Pull off the metal bracket (marked below, location seen
above) to AIBOs front.

<P></P>
4) Unplug both connectors, separate bottom assembly.
<P></P>
<img src="dhs_fix_82.jpg">

<P></P>
5) Seperate the two clevis mountings

<P></P>
6) By bending the cover (don't break it!) pull out the upper
clevis mounting, marked with an arrow below.
<P></P>
<img src="dhs_fix_83.jpg">

<P></P>
7) By pushing on the white plasic part, marked with an arrow
above, pull out the lower clevis mounting/motor assembly. (Again
you have to bend the cover on the lower side.)
<P></P>
<img src="dhs_fix_84.jpg">

<P></P>
8) Important: Mark the lower side of the white plastic part!
You will have to reassemble it exact the same position later!
<P></P>

9) Pull the whte plastic part off the axle (These are TWO
white parts, should they separate pull off BOTH)
<P></P>
<img src="dhs_fix_88.jpg">

<P></P>
10) Press the motor through the clevis mounting (from the
bottom to top). You will have to feed the flexible print through
the hole!

<P></P>
11) Remove the top cover (black) of the potentiometer assembly

<P></P>
12) Remove the slider of the variable resistor (TAKE NOTICE OF
THE POSITION FOR REASSEMBLY)!

<P></P>
13) Unsolder the flexible print on the MOTOR side (NOT on the
potentiometer side)

<P></P>
14) Carefully remove the variable resistor printed circuit
board from the motor

<P></P>
15) Pull out the axle FIRMLY. (You don't have to remove the
sawing ring!, The top cover of the gear will come out with the
axle! Don't loose any gear wheels!)

<P></P>
16) Now you can take the clutch assembly apart (see the parts
on the next picture)

<P></P>
17) Clean the three parts of the clutch assembly carefully
with alcohol and glue them together.
<P></P>
<img src="dhs_fix_90.jpg">

<DIR>Notes regarding gluing (from Phil):<BR>
Do not use cynoacrilates (super glue) for the bond they are not ideal for this type of plastic bond, the clutch is probably nylon.
<BR>
Use a two part epoxy with a slow cure rate, fast epoxies have an accelerator in them, which also weakens the bond.
<BR>
To make a strong bond the key is cleanliness:
<UL>
<LI>clean all the parts with an oil free solvent
<LI>if you don't have a solvent, then a good scrub in water with detergent will be almost as good
<LI>Roughening the surfaces with a fine abrasive paper before cleaning is also recommended.
</UL>
Mix the epoxy really well and let it stand for a few minutes to allow the air bubbles to dispel.
Apply a thin coat to both surfaces of the bond.
The bond should be held together without being held too firm.
For the best strength the bond thickness between the surfaces should be about 0.1mm (.004" inches).
Do not allow the bond to move in the first few hours while it is curing, and do not use the part for at least 24 hours.
If you do all this correctly the bond will never break.
</DIR>


<P></P>
18) Reassemble the gear as shown in the next picture (axle on bottom, gear wheels on top!)

<P></P>
19) Reassemble the gear by putting the motor on top of the
gear NOT VICE VERSA!

<P></P>
20) Test motor and gear by applying abt. 3 Volts
<P></P>
<img src="dhs_fix_93.jpg">

<P></P>
21) Glue the variable resistor print back in.
(BE CAREFUL NOT TO SPILL GLUE ON THE RESISTIVE AREA)!
<P></P>
<img src="dhs_fix_95.jpg">

<P></P>
22) Press the slider of the variable resistor in again (SAME
POSITION AS YOU REMOVED IT):

<P></P>
23) Glue the black cover on again. Press the white plastic
parts on the axle (AGAIN IN THE SAME POSITION AS REMOVED)!

<P></P>
24) Press the motor into the clevis mounting (INSERT THE FLEXIBLE PRINT THROUGH THE HOLE FIRST)!

<P></P>
25) Solder the flexible print to the motor connections again.

<P></P>
26) Insert the lower clevis mounting w. motor into the head
assembly by bending the cover (DON'T BREAK IT)!

<P></P>
27) Insert the upper clevis mounting again by bending the cover!

<P></P>
29) Reassemble the metal bracket

<P></P>
30) Reconnect the flexi-print (below the black insulating
plate) and the head-connector (above the insulating plate) to the
bottom assembly

<P></P>
31) Reassemble bottom with the clevis mountings..

<P></P>
32) Reassemble the cover. Insert and tighten the 8 screws.
(The 4 screws, fitting in an angle of 45 degrees are the longer ones!)

<P></P>
33) Put the head assemby on your Aibo and do final check!

<P></P>
34) If it works again, drink a cold beer!
