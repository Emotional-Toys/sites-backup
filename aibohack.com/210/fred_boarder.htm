Fred Flintstone SpeedBoarder is a themed personality created by 'teamdax' that lets AIBO play on the SpeedBoard on the ERS-2x0

<DIR><font color=red>WARNING: READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING THIS PERSONALITY<BR></font>
(otherwise you may damage your AIBO)
</DIR>

NOTE: This personality will only work on the 210/210A or 220/220A
This personality requires the use of the Aibo SpeedBoard, and replaces the standard SpeedBoard software.
Fred will respond to verbal commands and can take photos (while riding his SpeedBoard). If you leave him alone, he will get impatient.
Fred can get around, so please keep an eye on him.  
<BR>
If your AIBO has a WiFi card, see below for instructions for how to use remote control.

<LI>Download the proper RCodePlus runtime for the model of your AIBO.
<UL>
<LI>For the ERS-210: <A HREF="../rcode/RCodePlus252A(210).zip">RCode Plus 2.52 'A' (210)</A>
<LI>For the ERS-220: <A HREF="../rcode/RCodePlus252A(220).zip">RCode Plus 2.52 'A' (220)</A>
<LI>(Save this .ZIP file on your computer. You may want to use it again later.)
</UL>
<LI>Unzip this RCodePlus file to the root of your PMS memory stick.
<LI>Download the Fred SpeedBoarder personality for your model:
<UL>
<LI>For the ERS-210: <A HREF="fred_boarder210.zip">fred_boarder210.zip</A> (.8 MB)
<LI>For the ERS-220: <A HREF="fred_boarder220.zip">fred_boarder220.zip</A> (.8 MB)

<LI>Unzip that file on top of your RCODE/PMS stick (replacing any files it asks about).
<P></P>
<P></P>
<LI>Put the memory stick inside your AIBO and start it up.
<LI>Play with your AIBO. Follow the instructions (see below).
</UL>

<DIR><font color=red>WARNING: </font>Do not put AIBO on the SpeedBoard yet. If you do he will get his legs jammed in the handlebars during the startup.</DIR>

<H2>Extra LAN Installation</H2>
If you plan on using the WiFi LAN to remotely control AIBO on the SpeedBoard, perform the following additional steps:
<UL>
<LI>Copy over a known working WLANCONF.TXT to this memory stick (in the \OPEN-R\SYSTEM\CONF\WLAN\HTML folder).
<LI>Be sure AIBO has the WiFi card installed.
<LI>Download the AiboRemoteBoard program: <A HREF="AiboRemoteBoard.zip">AiboRemoteBoard.zip</A> and unzip it to a folder on your PC (eg: C:\AIBO).
You will use it later once AIBO is sitting on his board.
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Startup Instructions</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Be sure AIBO is not on the SpeedBoard and has room to stretch.
<LI>Insert pink stick and boot AIBO. Do not put him on the SpeedBoard yet.
<LI>Aibo will stretch, then assume the 'SpeedBoard crouch'. DO NOT PRESS HIS HEAD BUTTON
<LI>Now, place AIBO on his SpeedBoard (in same way as for the standard SpeedBoard software)
<LI>Press the head button. You will hear the Flintstones theme song and he will start in "Stand Alone" mode
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Usage Instructions - Stand Alone</H2>

Use any of the standard YART/RCodePlus <A HREF="../rcode/rc_vcmd.htm">voice commands</A>
(all 69 voice commands have an audio and/or action response- please try them all).
You will know if Fred hears you, he will flick his ears, and raise his tail.

<H3>Other stand-alone features</H3>
<UL>
<LI>If you need to leave Fred for a while, say "STOP".
He will snore, put his feet down, he will then not move or speak until you press his head button.
<LI>If you want to take a photo, press (and hold) his head button for 3 seconds (he will take a photo while moving along)
<LI>If you leave Fred alone- he will get very impatient, he will perform one of many routines, to try to get your attention.
<LI>Name/ owner recognition- these commands are supported- Fred will use his name, and your name occasionally
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Usage Instructions - Remote Control</H2>

AiboRemoteBoard is a modified version of the basic AiboRemote program used to control the Fred SpeedBoarder personality.

<center><IMG SRC="ss_remote_board.jpg"></center>

NOTE: your AIBO must have a valid WLANCONF.TXT file and be able to connect with your PC's WiFi LAN card. If you are not familiar with this process, you should start with AiboRemote or other LAN setup first.
 
If AIBO is not already running on his speedboard, you should start him up.
<UL>
<LI>Be sure AIBO is not on the SpeedBoard and has room to stretch.
<LI>Insert pink stick and boot AIBO. Do not put him on the SpeedBoard yet.
<LI>Aibo will stretch, then assume the 'SpeedBoard crouch'. DO NOT PRESS HIS HEAD BUTTON
<LI>Now, place AIBO on his SpeedBoard
(you do not need to press his head button)
<P></P>
</UL>

Now, you can run the remote control program:
<UL>
<LI>Run the AiboRemoteBoard.EXE program on your PC
<LI>enter your AIBO's IP address (just as you would for AiboRemote or other programs)
<LI>If it fails to connect, be sure you can 'ping' your AIBO from your PC
</UL>

<H3>Functions/ buttons</H3>

<UL>
<LI>"FL"/ "FR" - forward left / right. AIBO will turn his handlebars in the correct direction, and then kick
<LI>"FORWARD" - AIBO will point handlebars forward and kick
<LI>"LEFT" / "RIGHT" - AIBO turns handle bars in the correct direction.
He will not kick- this can be used when AIBO is coasting (backwards or forwards).
<LI>"STOP" - AIBO will put his feet down (to stop him).
This can also be used to reposition his hands (if they move)
<LI>"TURBO" - an extended forward kick
(HE NEEDS SPACE FOR THIS ACTION)
<LI>"BL" / "BR" - same as FL/FR but he kicks backwards.
</UL>

<H3>NOTES/TIPS:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>you can press a button more than once (or a combination of buttons)- for example click FORWARD/ FORWARD/ RIGHT (AIBO will kick twice, then turn the handlebars to the right)
<LI>This program runs much better on wood/ concrete floors (not so well on carpet)
<LI>CAMERA SETTINGS: - if the video is dark, you can adjust the camera using the Complex AiboRemote program (but do not use any of the other AiboRemote functions), after changing the camera settings, EXIT AiboRemote and start AiboRemoteBoard  the new camera settings will work until you turn your AIBO off.
<LI>Credits: Personality, motions and instructions by teamdax. AiboRemote and AiboRemoteBoard by AiboPet. Thanks to MEP and Robert for their help and suggestions.
