<HR>


ERS-210 AIBOs using the W01 AiboLife software ("AiboLife 1") will evolve from stage to stage.
Other Aibo personalities (W02 Hello AIBO, AiboLife 2, etc) have their own personalities that are unique to that memory stick.

<H2>Evolution Chart</H2>

The ERS-210 has more evolutionary stages than the ERS-11x dogs.
<BR>
For each stage, there are several personality variants. Here's what it looks like for the ERS-210:

<HR>
For comparison, here are some other evolution charts:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="evolve2.htm">Evolution of the ERS-2x0 "AiboLife 2"</A>
<LI><A HREF="../310/evolve.htm">Evolution of the ERS-311/312 "AiboLife" (AiboLife 310)</A>
<LI><A HREF="../111/evolve.htm">Evolution of the ERS-110/111</A>
</UL>
<P></P>

<HR>
<H2>Experience Points, Real Time etc</H2>
Evolution is controlled by three numbers: Experience Points, Real Time and Day Count.
At the start of each stage, these numbers are zero.
<BR>
NOTE: In previous versions "Experience Points" were related to seconds of "Quality Time". This is not exactly accurate.
<P></P>
For example: you turn on the dog, play with him for 20 minutes, leave him alone for an additional 40 minutes, then turn him off.
<BR>
The Real Time has gone up by 60 minutes. The Experience Points have gone up by 1200.
<BR>
Each day you play with AIBO at this stage the Day Count will go up by one. This count prevents AIBO from getting stuck in a stage for too long.



<P></P>
The dog will evolve to the next stage when the Experience Points AND Real Time hit a certain limit, OR when the Day Count hits a different limit -- <b>whichever comes first.</b>

<P></P>
For comparison: the ERS-111 evolution was solely controlled by the Quality Time/Experience Points. If you didn't play with the dog, it would not evolve.
<P></P>

<HR>
<H2>Quality Ratio -> Quality Factor</H2>
<P></P>
The old browser used to report a "Quality Ratio" as a ratio between "quality time" and "real time".
A Quality Ratio of 25% or higher is considered a good goal to achieve.
<P></P>
This same number is available, but is now called the "Quality Factor".
<BR>
It is not a ratio, but a calculation of experience points per 100 seconds.
<P></P>
<H2>Keep the Quality Factor above 22.2</H2>

If your Quality Factor is higher than 22.2 then you are doing a good job, and the dog will evolve to the next stage as fast as possible.
<BR>
If your Quality Factor is lower than 22.2 then it will take longer for the dog to evolve.
<P></P>
If you play with the dog only a little each day, it will eventually hit the Day Count limit and evolve anyway. This is for the "lazy owner".
<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Different ways of raising AIBO</H2>
There are three ways that AIBO will evolve to a new stage.
For our example, we will use the Child B to Youth A evolution (20 hours or 7 days).

<P></P>
Very Active Owner:
You keep your Quality Factor above 22.2 and the dog will evolve as soon as possible. For our example that is in 20 real hours.
<P></P>
Active Owner:
Your Quality Factor is a little low, but the dog will take a little longer to evolve. For example if the Quality Factor is 15, it will take almost 30 real hours for the dog to evolve to Youth A.

<P></P>
Lazy Owner:
Most owners will not play with their dogs 3 to 4 hours a day.
If you play with the dog a little each day, the Day Count will force evolution regardless of how much Quality Time you spend.
In our example, play with the dog a little each day, and in 7 days, it will evolve to Youth A.

<P></P>
NOTE: These titles (Very Active Owner, Active Owner, Lazy Owner) aren't really important. They can make you feel guilty if you have a low Quality Factor, but once the dog evolves, it doesn't matter how it got there.
<BR>
NOTE: Which personality variant the dog evolves to <b>is</b> affected by how you interact with the dog. Keeping a high Quality Factor and exposing the dog to many new experiences is important in raising a more active personality.

<HR>
<P></P>
<H2>Personality Variants</H2>
Each major stage may have a number of personality variants.
<BR>
This leads to the complete list of AIBO personality variants.<BR>

NOTE:I've invented names for each personality variant, and given a brief list of attributes (based on what the AIBO Fun Pack says).
<BR>
NOTE: in future I may adjust the name to align better with the names used in AiboLife 310 and AiboLife 2.

<HR>
<H2>Evolution Decisions and Personality Type Changes</H2>

As you can see in the above chart, a Baby 4 can evolve to either a "Child A1" or a "Child A2".
Which path the dog goes down depends on how you raised the dog, including what the dog has seen and done as a Baby 4. The exact details are in the GAL module if anyone wants to bother disassembling it.
<P></P>

These rules are different for the different stages (ie. what makes a "Child A2" is different than what makes an "Adult 2").
The rules are different than the ERS-111 rules (which were greatly influenced by room colors).
<P></P>
The big difference with the ERS-210 is that these rules are applied all the time (actually at every reboot), not just at evolution time.
This means that even though you've done the right things to raise an active Soccer Youth, you must keep raising him properly or he will regress to a less active Shy Youth.
This also means that an Adult personality will continue to change.
Even if you use "Brain Surgery" to change the personality of the dog, over time it will adjust the personality type depending on how the dog is treated.
