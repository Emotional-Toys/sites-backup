 PleoRB Hardware Overview

<HR>


Please refer to my <A HREF="../pleo/tech1.htm">original UGOBE Pleo teardown</A> for background. It is old, but still accurate.
<BR>
For a general overview of the older models, I recommend the excellent <A HREF="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/pleo.htm">How Stuff Works</A> article by Tracy Wilson.
<P></P>
<BR>
Much of the PleoRB is similar to the original model.
This page focuses on changes in the PleoRB hardware.

<BR>

<H2>Overview of Hardware Changes</H2>

<H3>External Hardware</H3>
<UL>
<LI>New battery (old NiMHd 2.2AHr, new lighter LiPoly 2.8AHr). Charger logic much improved.
<LI>USB connection moved inside of battery compartment. Looks like old terminal feature not supported.
<LI>No hardware serial connector. Much harder for debugging remote control apps.
<LI>SD card replaced with micro SD card inside of battery compartment. Makes swapping personalities more difficult.
<LI>Real-Time-Clock battery in foot.
</UL>
<BR>
<H3>Internal Hardware - Main Body</H3>
<UL>
<LI>DataFlash in the main body doubled in size (4MB -> 8MB). Default personality program (PLEOPM) needs it.
<LI>Main CPU appears to be same (Atmel AT91SAM7S256). Still only 64KB of RAM (KiloBytes is not a typo).
<LI>3D axis accelerometer in upper body (KXTF9 on I2C bus along with another chip)
<LI>Additional touch sensors (now 2 on back, 2 on butt/arse)
<LI>Much of the rest looks similar to original Pleo (Toshiba TMP85FH47 motor controllers, etc).
</UL>
<BR>
<H3>Internal Hardware - Head</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Overworked head CPU replaced with two chips (new chip specs unknown).
<UL>
<BR><I>Before</I><BR>
<LI>The old Pleo head CPU did poor sound direction detection, and slow camera capture.
<LI>The old chip was ARM based with 32KB of flash ROM for code. The old chip did everything: sound detection, camera interface and various head specific features.
<BR><I>After (PleoRB)</I><BR>
<LI>The new PleoRB does true voice commands (8 of them), faster camera access (?) and other things.
<LI>These tasks are split between two different CPUs:
<LI>The smaller chip has 128KB of flash ROM for code. Chip specs unknown. Probably doing the voice recognition feature.
Appears similar to the RSC-300 feature of the <A HREF="../icybie/autopsy.htm">iCybie</A>.
Lets you record 8 unique speaker dependent voice commands and use them to trigger specific modes.
<LI>The larger new chip has 1MB of flash ROM. Chip specs unknown. Probably doing the camera interfacing and other head sensor control.
<LI>Neither of these chips are meant to be user programmable. The Pawn personality program (interpreted by the main CPU in the body) is programmable with the PDK.
</UL><BR>
<LI>RFID detection in mouth. See <A HREF="tech2rb.htm">this page</A> for the list of known RFID toys.
<LI>Additional touch sensors (2 new ones in cheeks)
<LI>Additional sensors (light, temperature)
<LI>Head servo configuration changed
<LI>Still only 64KB in serial SRAM (used for image capture)
<LI>Camera marked "JS668850" - same as last version?
<LI>Slow data connection between head and body is claimed to be fixed - but needs testing with real timing.
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<P></P>
<H2>Software/Firmware</H2>
There are several different pieces of firmware/software in the Pleo.
<UL>
<LI>The main personality. Often called "PLEOPM". Closed source. A "Pawn" interpreted program. Program and data (sound, motions etc) filling most of the 8MB of data store.
See <A HREF="tech3rb.htm">this page</A> for more info.
<LI>The main CPU firmware. Closed source. ARM code filling most of the 256KB of Flash ROM in the main CPU. Probably very similar to the old version.
<LI>The two head CPUs have their own firmware. I assume they have a similar update mechanism like the original model. Much more complicated firmware for camera and sound features.
<LI>The motion controller firmware. Closed source. Toshiba TMP (Z80-like) code in the 4 motion/servo controllers. Probably very similar to the old version.
</UL>
Note: AFAIK all software/firmware is updatable (typically by installing a special update program in the SD card).
<BR>
Note: all software/firmware is <i>currently</i> closed source and proprietary.
