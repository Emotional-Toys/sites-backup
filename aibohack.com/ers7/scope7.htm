NOTE: OBSOLETE - for AiboMind1 with AiboMindPlus patch installed. Instead I strongly recommend you upgrade to AiboMind2 which has many 'plus' features built in and use <A HREF="scope7m2.htm">AiboScope7M2 </A>

<P></P>

AiboScope7 is used in conjunction with an <A HREF="mindplus.htm">"Aibo Mind Plus"</A> memory stick. This allows you to monitor your AIBO from your computer while AIBO is walking around the room and living its life.
<P></P>
AiboScope7 only works with an ERS-7 hooked up to your PC computer via the Wireless LAN card.
<DIR><I>This is the first release of Scope7 (7.01.01)
<BR>
The reporting and radar features are still being improved to be more informative.
If you have suggestions, please let me know.
The audio "spy microphone" feature can be choppy.
</I></DIR>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Overview</H2>

There are many features of AiboScope7:
<UL>
<LI>Works with "Aibo Mind Plus" and your own AIBO's personality
<LI>Show a "live" picture of what AIBO is seeing with his camera. For the ERS-7 this is a very large image (416x320)
<LI>Show 8 smaller pictures showing what colors are detected
<LI>Lets you adjust the camera settings in real-time
<LI>The "Commands" list shows a log of the voice commands AIBO has heard and the AiboCards AIBO has seen
<LI>Shows the current mood values. These are in the range 0 to 100
<LI>Show a lower level log of all the input events influencing AIBO
<LI>Shows two radar plots of what AIBO is sensing and from what direction
<LI>Optionally plays live sound from what your AIBO is hearing on your PC's speakers. This can be choppy in the current version.
<LI>With sound turned off, you can get relatively good video frame rates.
<LI>Support for several video codecs (in general just use the default)
</UL>

<H2>Features in Detail</H2>

<H3>Camera</H3>
At the upper left is the video camera feed from AIBO's nose camera.
Typically it will update several times per second.
<P></P>
The 3X3 grid of buttons under "Camera Settings" lets you adjust the camera's White Balance, Gain and Shutter Speed.
These are standard for other LAN tools (like AiboRemote and RacerControl) and can be used to adjust the best settings for color detection.
<P></P>
NOTE: AiboCam does not yet support the ERS-7. AiboCam is a separate utility that can capture the video directly (without the overhead of AiboScope) and save it as a AVI file.

<H3>Color Detection</H3>
The 8 smaller images (4x2) to the right of the camera image show the color detection of AIBO. There is one image for each of the 8 color detection settings.
The images are shown in appropriate colors (ie. there is both a Red and Pink that get interpreted as the "Ball").

<H3>Camera Settings and Color Detection and PLUSCON</H3>
<I>How to make AIBO see better in dark rooms.</I>
<BR>
First aim AIBO's nose at the green and blue charger target.
Use the 3X3 "Camera Settings" buttons to find the best setting that give distinctive green and blue patterns in the small color displays.
This will increase the chances of AIBO getting on his charger properly.

<P></P>
You must repeat this process every time you boot up your ERS-7 or change the room lighting.

If your room lighting conditions don't change often, you can run the PLUSCON program on the memory stick to set the defaults for the 3 camera settings.
These will be used even if you don't use the Scope7 program.

<H3>The Radar Screens</H3>
When AIBO detects interesting things with his camera, IR range sensor or ears, it has a rough idea of where those things are in 3D relative to his head.
The radar screens try to show those 3D positions in two 2D plots.

<BR>
The top radar is trying to show an AIBO eye's view of what is going on. AIBO's nose is looking into the page.
Most of the interesting things (BALL color, HAND, VOICE, ...) are right in front and a little below his nose.
<BR>
The bottom radar view is from the top looking down at AIBO (his nose is facing up)
<BR>
NOTE: some guesswork involved, radar displays are being improved

<P></P>
<H3>Moods</H3>
The current mood values are reported here.
Moods are in the range 0 to 100.
If the mood level is reported as '?' that means the mood level has not changed recently (recent enough for the Scope7 program to record it).
It is these mood levels that influence the dog's behavior.

<BR>
NOTE: some guesswork involved, actual mood names are subject to change

<P></P>
<H3>Command log</H3>
This is a list of all the voice commands detected by AIBO.
The most recently heard voice command is at the bottom.
Also, the AIBO Cards are reported here.

<P></P>
<H3>Event Log</H3>
At the very right is the low level raw Event log.
These have a textual list of almost all events detected by AIBO.
These are the same Semantic Input Events that drive the behavior of AIBO.
<BR>
Most of the useful event data is shown elsewhere on the AiboScope display.
Reading this log will tell you the order things happened,
give you other events info (like LOUD sounds or BONE detection)
and adds to your insight into what is happening inside of AIBO's brain.

<H1>Installation and Usage</H1>
</center></td></tr> </TABLE>
<HR>
<H2>Installation</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Follow the <A HREF="mindplus.htm">installation instructions</A> for one of Aibo Mind Plus. Be sure to configure the WLANCONF.TXT file so you can connect to your AIBO via WiFi.
<LI>You must know your AIBO's IP address (usually 10.0.1.100)
<P></P>
<LI>Download <A HREF="http://aibohack.com/ers7/AiboScope7_01.zip">AiboScope7_01.zip</A>
<LI>Unzip the AiboScope7_01.zip onto your PC (any directory you wish). The Scope7.EXE and Scope7.INI files must be in the same folder.
</UL>

<P></P>
<H2>Usage - getting it running</H2>
<UL>
<LI>If you have an ad-hoc WiFi connection, be sure the link light on your PC WiFi card is on or blinking first
<LI>The AIBO WiFi card must be turned on (the little switch on the bottom of the ERS-7)
<LI>Boot up your ERS-7 with the AiboMindPlus stick installed.
<P></P>
<LI>I recommend you try pinging your AIBO first ("ping 10.0.1.100").
If that doesn't work, fix your net connection, or try rebooting your AIBO.
<P></P>
<LI>Run the Scope7.EXE program on your PC.
<LI>When prompted, enter the IP address of your AIBO.
<LI>There are other options for changing the video and capture options, but start with the defaults.
<LI>If connected, you should see the camera data and other telemetry displayed on the screen.
<LI>If it fails, try pinging your AIBO.
<P></P>
<LI>Sit back watch while you interact with you AIBO (there is little to change in the AiboScope screen).
<BR>WARNING: When AIBO is walking around sending data with the LAN card, the dog heats up faster and the battery does not last as long (compared to a normal ERS-7 playing alone)
</UL>
