Adds FIVE new dances for each of the postures (sit, stand, sleep/lay down, station).
Twenty new songs/dances. Over 40 minutes of Christmas and Holiday tunes !
<BR>
Aibo Custom Manager compatible DANCE pack (can easily be removed using the trashcan or replaced with another dance pack).

<HR>
<H2>Supported AIBOs</H2>

<UL>
<LI><IMG SRC="../gfx/icon_7.gif"> - ERS-7 is supported with AiboMind software [original or with SP1]
</UL>


<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Required Hardware/Software:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>An ERS-7 model AIBO
<LI>An AiboMind stick (ERF-7AW01E) that came with the ERS-7
<LI>Your AIBO must be an adult, otherwise he won't listen to the "let's dance" voice command. If not, use the ERS-7 Browser to change him to an adult (BACKUP YOUR STICK FIRST)
<P></P>
<LI>A Windows based PC
<LI>A memory stick reader (<font color=red>Sony brand stick reader strongly recommended</font>)
<P></P>
<LI>You must have the free <A HREF=http://www.us.aibo.com/acd.htm>Aibo Custom Manager (ACM)</A> installed on your PC.
<LI>You should be generally familiar with how the ACM works.
<LI>I strongly recommend you install the ACM program in the default folder on your C: drive:
<BR>
<B>C:\Program Files\Sony\Aibo Custom Manager</B>
<BR>
(it will make everything easier)
</UL>
<P></P>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Installation</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Download this self extracting ACD data file <A HREF="apacd_xmas03.exe">apacd_xmas03.exe</A> (2.2MB)
<LI>Run it on your PC. If you have installed the ACM in the recommended folder on your C: drive, you can use the default unzip location.
<LI>After installation you don't need the acd_xmas03.exe file/program anymore (it has installed the necessary ACM data onto your PC).
<P></P>
<LI>Run the Aibo Custom Manager (ACM) software. You should now see a new entry in the "Custom Data List" called "XMas 03 Dances"
<LI>Insert your AiboMind memory stick into your PC memory stick reader.
<LI>Inside the ACM program:
<UL>
<LI>Click the "Drive Path" to point to your memory stick drive.
<LI>You will see any existing customizations in the list on the left hand side.
<LI>Double click on the "XMas03 Dances" custom data (in the right hand list)
<LI>It should appear in the left hand side list in red.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ss_acm_xmas03.jpg">
<BR>NOTE: 'XMas03 Dances' on the left hand side is RED after it has been added but before it has been written to the memory stick</CENTER>
<P></P>
<LI>Press the "Write" button (bottom of the ACM) and click "OK" when asked
<LI>Wait while the memory stick is being updated
<LI>When complete, you normally don't need to eject the stick (on Windows XP)
<LI>Exit the ACM
</UL>
<P></P>
<LI>Put the memory stick in your AIBO and start him up (see Usage instructions below).
<LI>NOTE: You may uninstall this dance pack at any time (use the trash can) or replace them with another dance pack. You may reinstall it later using the ACM.
</UL>

<H2>Usage</H2>

Dance packs work within the standard AiboMind personality.
You have to say "Let's Dance" when he is quiet and waiting for input.
He should flash his visor white to confirm, then start a randomly picked dance (depending on his current posture).
Alternatively, you can show him the "Dance" card.
<P></P>
The posture of the dog matters when it hears the "Let's Dance" command (or sees the card).
If you say "Let's Dance" when sitting you will see a totally different set of songs/dances than if the dog is standing (or lying down, or on the charger station)
There are six choices for each posture. They are picked at random when you say "Let's Dance" (or show AIBO the Dance card).
One of the six is the standard dance (not Xmas themed). The other five are XMas themed songs.
<P></P>
If it randomly picks a dance you don't want to hear (or the one you just heard), press his head to stop him, then after a second or so, say "Let's Dance" again and hopefully it will pick a song/dance you haven't heard yet.
<BR>
A few songs are short (around 30 seconds), but most are long (2 minutes or longer, some over 4 minutes).
If the dance steps become repetitive or if it gets too boring, press the dog's head and he will stop the current dance, and you can try again.

<P></P>
NOTE: Dance packs work within the standard AiboMind personality.
If AIBO sees something interesting (eg: a pink ball), the floor, has his head pressed or other stimulation, he will stop the current dance.
To see and hear one of the longer dances, you need to leave him alone and let him perform.
<P></P>
Try all the postures (including on the station). There are a total of 24 song and dances, 20 of which are new to this dance pack.
