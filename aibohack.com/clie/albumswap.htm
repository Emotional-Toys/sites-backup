<HR>


AlbumSwap (version 1.1) is a simple utility to swap albums (play lists) for AudioPlayer.
<BR>
It is designed for very fast switching and tries to do all the work for you (normally no extra steps required).
<P></P>
It supports two different ways of organizing your albums (and a hybrid):
<UL>
<LI>Method 1 - all MP3s in one folder (MSAUDIO) and multiple .M3U playlists
<LI>Method 2 - each MP3 collection in a separate folder (ALBUM_???) and an optional MP3LIST.M3U
<LI>Method 2+1 - a combination of Method 2 and Method 1
</UL>
Method 2 is newer and recommended.
Method 2 is much faster, especially if you have many songs on each storage card.
<P></P>

NOTE: I will use the terms "album" and "play list" interchangably. Either is just a collection of MP3s that are normally played in order.
<BR>
NOTE: I will use the terms "folder" and "directory" interchangably.
<P></P>

<P>Features</P>
<UL>
<LI>works with NX and NZ AudioPlayer
<LI>works with TG50 AudioPlayer (method 2)
<LI>may work with other CLIE models (incl NR series, method 2)
<LI>displays list of available albums
<LI>supports two different ways of organizing you music (see below) as well as a special hybrid of the two
<LI>automatically re-mounts storage device (CF or MS) so you don't have to pull it out and re-insert it
<LI>will autolaunches AudioPlayer (so you don't have to) and in full screen mode
<LI>compatible with AudioPlayer in background play mode (background playing will stop after the swap)
<LI>compatible with most memory stick or compact flash variations (but only the first VFS volume where it finds .M3U files)
<LI>JogDial navigation
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>One Time Install</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Download <A HREF="ClieAlbumSwap11.zip">ClieAlbumSwap11.zip</A>
<LI>Unzip and install AlbumSwap.prc to you CLIE (usually with HotSync).
<LI>In AudioPlayer turn off "Reset PB mode by album change" and it will work automatically (not essential but it makes things much more convenient)
</UL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Media Preparation</H2>

For each storage card (MS or CF), you need to prepare your music.
You should already be familiar with how to create compatible MP3 files (ie. no VBR files).

<H3>Method 2 - New and Recommended</H3>

<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>Copy your MP3 files into separate folders on the storage card (MS or CF)
<BR>How you organize your music collection is up to you.
<LI>These folders must be created in the "\PALM\Programs" parent folder
<LI>Each folder name must start with "ALBUM_"
The part of the folder name after "ALBUM_" is up to you.
<LI>You do not need to create any .M3U files.
The AudioPlayer will play the songs in the order you copy them to the storage card.
<LI>If there is a "\PALM\Programs\MSAUDIO" folder on the storage card, be sure to delete it before the first time you use AlbumSwap.
<LI>NOTE: the current album will be renamed to "MSAUDIO" when in use.
Only delete the MSAUDIO folder during the initial setup.

<P></P>
Sample:
<pre>
    \PALM\Programs\ALBUM_My First Collection\Song1.mp3
    \PALM\Programs\ALBUM_My First Collection\Song2.mp3
    \PALM\Programs\ALBUM_My Second Collection\Song3.mp3
    \PALM\Programs\ALBUM_My Second Collection\Song4.mp3
</pre>

<LI>Optional: if you want more control over the play order, you can create an MP3LIST.M3U file in the proper ALBUM_??? folder.
That MP3LIST.M3U should only contain the file names of the MP3 files in that same ALBUM_??? folder.
<BR>
BTW: You can edit the MP3LIST.M3U file manually, or use the AudioPlayer playlist arranging feature.
</UL>

<P></P>

<H3>Method 1 - older way</H3>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>Copy all your MP3 files into one folder on the storage card (MS or CF)
<LI>This must be the standard audio folder:
<pre>
    \PALM\Programs\MSAUDIO
</pre>
<LI>Do not create an MP3LIST.M3U file
<LI>Instead, create several ????.M3U files in the same folder.
Each one represents a playlist.
These playlist files can be named anything, just be sure they end in .M3U (and are not called MP3LIST.M3U)
<pre>
    Alanis.m3u
    RockTheCasba.m3u
    MellowTracks.m3u
</pre>
How you organize your music collection is up to you.
<LI>.M3U files are text files with the filenames of the .MP3 files (no folder part, just the file name with extension).
You can edit them with any text editor.
<pre>
    Song01.mp3
    Song02.mp3
    ...
</pre>
<LI>Note the .mp3 song files must be in the same folder as the .M3U playlist file.
</UL>

<P></P>
<H3>Method 2+1 - use both !</H3>
First organize your main music into separate folders as described in Method 2.
Then on a case by case basis, you can create multiple playlists within each ALBUM_??? folder, as described in Method 1.
<BR>
The AlbumSwap program is smart enough to detect this case.
When run it will let you pick from the playlists within the current ALBUM_??? folder.
When you want to switch to a different ALBUM_??? folder, press the "Up" button (that will magically appear) and switch the folder/directory.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Usage</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Run AlbumSwap (making it a quick-launch app is recommended).
<BR>NOTE: will work even if AudioPlayer is playing in the background
<LI>Pick the album/playlist you want to hear.
<LI>Press the "Swap" button.
<P></P>
<LI>You should automatically go back to AudioPlayer
</UL>

The first time you have to select the playlist manually.
Press the sort option (top, 3rd button from right) and then press OK for the new playlist to take effect.

<P></P>
If you didn't turn off "Reset PB mode by album change" you will have to do this all the time you swap albums.
If you did turn it off, the new album list will select automatically after the first time.

<BR>
If you use the regular playlist editing features (that edits the current MP3LIST.M3U file), you may lose changes after the next swap.
Changes will be wiped out when using Method 1 or Method 2+1.
Changes will be saved when using Method 2.
