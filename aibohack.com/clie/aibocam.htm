<H2>Required Hardware</H2>
<UL>
<LI>An ERS-210[A] or ERS-220[A] AIBO
<LI>An AIBO LAN (WiFi) card installed in the dog
<LI>A PMS pink stick with an RCodePlus personality on it (eg: DogsLife), _OR_
<LI>A non-PMS pink stick with a LifePlus personality on it (eg: AiboLife2 Plus)
<LI>An access point is recommended
<LI>A PC with a WiFi card is strongly recommended for initial setup and testing
<P></P>
<LI>A WiFi capable CLIE
<UL>
<LI>An NX or NZ series with a WiFi card (WL100 or WL110) _OR_
<LI>A UX50 (WiFi built in)
</UL>
<BR>
NOTE:The CLIE, AIBO, PC and optional access point must all have the same SSID and WEP settings. They all must have unique IP addresses.
</UL>

<P></P>
<H2>Installation</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Download and install <A HREF="AiboCam02.prc">AiboCam02.prc</A> to your CLIE (ie. download, double click on it, then run Hotsync).
<LI>If you haven't done it already, setup your CLIE's WiFi to the proper AIBO settings (usually SSID="AIBONET", WEP enabled, key="AIBO2"). Test by 'ping'ing the CLIE from your PC.
<LI>If running on battery, increase the power-off delay of the CLIE.
The current version does not handle power-down well (usually you will have to reboot the CLIE, and maybe the AIBO to reconnect)
</UL>
<P></P>

<H2>Connecting (can be frustrating)</H2>
<UL>
<LI>If you have an access point, or an active PC WiFi card, then you can start up AIBO now.
<LI>If you don't have an access point or active PC WiFi card (or you are away from your computer), then you must manually start the CLIE WiFi card.
Use the 'Prefs' program and start the WiFi connection first.
Then boot AIBO.
<LI>When AIBO has started, start the 'AiboCam' program on the CLIE.
<BR>
NOTE: if it reports an error, you may need to reboot your CLIE (soft reset by pressing the recessed reset button).
This is the easiest way to make a good connection.
Enter AIBO's IP address if different from the default (or last used)
<LI>It should connect within a few seconds. If not, it may ask you to reboot either the CLIE or the AIBO.
If AIBO is not found, check the general advice.
In particular be sure you can 'ping' both the PDA and AIBO from your PC.
<BR>
DISCLAIMER: if the LAN settings are not setup <i>just right</i> it can be a frustrating experience!
</UL>
<P></P>

<HR>
<H2>Usage - general Camera</H2>
<UL>
<LI>When connected, you can pick the camera update speed from the menu or the buttons on the screen.
<LI>"Medium" (the "Med" button) is a good setting to start
<LI>"Manual" will stop the camera update, and will only update the display when you want to.
<LI>If you have a UX50, press the "Wide" button to see a double size image. Press the button again if you don't like it that big.
<LI>If you have a NX/NZ, press the "Tall" button to see a double size image, rotated. Press the button again if you don't like it that way.
<LI>Under the "Cam" menu, you can adjust the camera settings.
<BR>
For a dark room, "High Gain" and "Slow Shutter" work best.
<BR>
Play around with the White Balance ("Inside", "Outside", "Fluores.") to get the best color reproduction.
</UL>

<P></P>
If you are running a LifePlus personality, that's about all you can do.
Let the personality do its thing, and you can watch.

<P></P>
<H2>Usage - RCodePlus/AiboRemote</H2>
If you are running an RCodePlus Personality, there are "AiboRemote" features.
<UL>
<P>RCode menu</P>
<LI>Command AIBO to sit, stand or lie down.
<LI>Turn the ERS-220 spotlight on and off (does nothing on the ERS-210)
<LI>When AiboCam initially connects to AIBO, it will stop the RCodePlus personality.
If you pick "Run", it will run the personality on the stick.
If you then send walk commands, they will compete with the personality.
<P>Walk menu</P>
<LI>You can pick a walking command from this menu. I recommend you use the keyboard interface instead.
<LI>You can pick a walking speed/style ("Slow", "Norm", "Fast"). Do this before issuing a walk command.
<P>Look menu</P>
<LI>You can move AIBO's neck to make him look in a certain direction.
I recommend you use the keyboard interface instead.

</UL>

<P></P>
<H3>Keyboard Commands</H3>
<pre>
Moving AIBO

        Q W E
        A S D
        Z X C

    W = forward
    S = stop
    X = backward
    others = turns


Looking around:
        U I O
        H J K
        B N M

    J = look centered
    I = look up
    N = look down
    ...

Other:
    1 = set slow walking speed
    2 = set normal walking speed
    3 = set fast walking speed

</pre>
<P></P>
<HR>

<H2>General WiFi recommendations</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Be sure to run the PC version of AiboRemote (for RCodePlus) or AiboScope (for LifePlus) _before_ trying the PDA version
<LI>The PDA's WiFi card must be setup to use the standard AIBO LAN network (by default: AIBONET, with WEP key "AIBO2")
<LI>The default AIBO IP address (10.0.1.100) is recommended (unless you can't use it in your setting)
<LI>If you don't have an access point, be sure you WiFi card's "Link" light is on/flashing before you boot your AIBO!
<LI>Use of an access point is recommended to keep the WiFi connection alive, especially during the boot process.
<LI>During initial setup, a PC with WiFi card (for ping tests) is recommended.
<LI>If you can't connect, be sure you can ping both the AIBO (usually 10.0.1.100) and the PDA from your PC.
<LI>You will reboot often. This is the best way of getting the WiFi into a known state.
