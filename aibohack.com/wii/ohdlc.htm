<H2>Terminology</H2>
"DLC" means "DownLoadable Content" for the AC:CF game.
You can get DLC directly from Nintendo in country specific giveaways, or by trading/visiting a friends town over WiFi.
There is room for a total of 256 DLC items (of all kinds).
<P></P>
There are three kinds of DLC: Official Nintendo DLC (currently 5 items), Experimental/Overlapped Hacked DLC (OHDLC, currently 3 items) and future Good Hacked DLC (currently 0 items).
They all have their own item ranges and do not need to collide.
<H3>Nintendo DLC</H3>
Nintendo has released a number of Official Nintendo "DLC" items.
Nintendo has "giveaways" in specific countries for a short period of time (usually 1 or 2 weeks).
Once the giveaway is over, you can't get the item directly from Nintendo anymore.
Nintendo giveaways are usually timed to national holidays (eg: Xmas or St Patrick's Day) or other Nintendo product releases (eg: Pikmin).
Not all giveaways include DLC.
<P></P>
Once Nintendo releases an item, they can't change it.
However once released, you can trade with other players and get the items.
DLC items themself are universal. Japanese items work in other regions, once you get them from a friend.
<P></P>
As of now, there are 5 official Nintendo items:
<UL>
<LI>"red Pikmin" - hat item (released Xmas 08 in Japan, later in other regions)
<LI>"top" - furniture item (released New Years 09 in Japan)
<LI>"Girl's Day updo" - tiara item (released March 09 in Japan)
<LI>"tokonoma" - banner furniture item (released March 09 in Japan)
<LI>"shamrock hat" - hat item (released March 09 in US and UK/EU)
<LI>and another new japanese item announced for early April
</UL>

<P></P>
"HDLC" means "Hacked DownLoadable Content"
HDLC is DLC created by 'Hackers' not Nintendo.

There is a special kind of Hacked DLC called "OHDLC".
It means "Overlapped Hacked DownLoadable Content".
With "OHDLC" hackers can play around with new hacked DLC, including big crayons and swords, with zero or minimal impact on regular users.

<BR>
Currently there are 3 OHDLC item slots.
Back in January I released 3 test hacked items ("ShinyBluePikmin", "RedLightSabreV1" and 
"BlueLightSabreV1").
In the next few months, you may see many OHDLC items, but they will reuse a small number of OHDLC item codes.
These newer OHDLC items will usually have "HDLC" in the name.
For example:
<UL>
<LI>"BigAxe1 HDLC"
<LI>"GreenCrayon HDLC"
<LI>"GuitarAxe1 HDLC"
<LI>"BigAxe2 HDLC"
<LI>"RedCrayon HDLC"
<LI>"LameKatana1 HDLC"
</UL>
<BR>

In the future, hacked DLC items will improve and the best ones will be voted on and released as permanent HDLC for all to use (hackers and non-hackers alike).
If interested, please read and comment on the "New Plan" <A HREF="http://game-hackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1318">on this thread on game-hackers.com</A> (registration required).<BR>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Non-Hackers can ignore "OHDLC"</H2>

"OHDLC" is for hackers only.
For non-hackers who already have the 3 original hacked items
("ShinyBluePikmin", "RedLightSabreV1" and "BlueLightSabreV1") their 'slots' are filled with the initial items.
They are inoculated from getting or seeing the new items.
<P></P>
For example, lets say a hacker installs the big axes into his game.
He visits his non-hacker friend who has the old light sabres.
They start an axe fight.
<BR>
The hacker will see something like this:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ohdlc/mixed_town_big_axes.jpg"> </CENTER>
The non-hacker will see something like this:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ohdlc/mixed_town_with_redsabres.jpg"> </CENTER>
The same items working (more or less) the same way in two different town views.
Mixing OHDLC items is safe because of the way it is designed and the careful choice of item codes.
<BR>
BTW: In the future there may be more OHDLC slots used up (for new item types like slingshots and other item types), but no more than 8 total.

<BR>
NOTE: If a non-hacker <B>really</B> wants a specific OHDLC item, it is possible if they are willing to restart their town, and making sure the first town they visit is a hacker friend who has the OHDLC combination they want.
This is too much work IMHO. It is easier to learn how to hack your town yourself.
<BR>
Similarly, there is no reason to 'trade' these new OHDLC items.
<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Coexisting with Nintendo</H2>

There are 256 possible spaces (or "slots") for DLC.
They must be shared by everyone. Nintendo gets most of them.
As part of the "New Plan", the item codes and spaces/slots used by hackers are separate from those currently used by Nintendo.
There is plenty of room for Nintendo and Hackers to share.
<BR>
With the extra space reuse of "OHDLC" then hackers can experiment more freely without using up any more space.
Even lame experimental items like crayons can be played with, since they don't eat up any more space.
