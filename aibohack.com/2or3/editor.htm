<HR>


Please refer to the <A HREF="dancetut.htm">Online Dance Choreography Tutorial</A> for how to use the editor to make AIBO dance.

<H2>Two Versions</H2>
There are two separate versions of the AIBO Editor, one for the ERS-11x (AIBO Editor) and a different version for the ERS-2x0 and 31x models ("AEditor23" described here).
The functionality of the two editors is very similar.
The motion (.MTN) and eye flashing (.LED) file formats are different.
Please be sure you use the correct version of the editor.
<BR>
If you have ERS-111 motions you want converted to ERS-210 format (or vice versa), please send me an email.

<H2>Overview</H2>
AEditor23 is a tool for creating and editing AIBO performances for the ERS-210, ERS-31x and ERS-220.
AEditor will edit body motions (in .MTN files) and eye flashing (in .LED files).
You can load in audio files (.WAV or .MID files) and the editor will let you view and play them (WAV only).
AEditor does not edit audio files. Please prepare your audio in other tools before using the AIBO editor.
<br>
AEditor23 is a multi-track editor that edits the audio, eye flashing and body motions all in a time synchronized format. You can click on the different tracks to edit the values.

<HR>
<H2>Using AEditor23 with Master Studio</H2>
The Performance Editor can be used in conjunction with Master Studio.
Use the Master Studio Behavior Arranger ("BA") to create behaviors.
Use the Master Studio Action Composer ("AC") to create performance data files, and do general editing.
Then for more sophisticated editing, you can use the AiboPet editor ("AEditor23") for mouth movements, dance steps etc.

<H3>Setting up performance files</H3>
When using the Action Composer, be sure to place all .MTN, .WAV and .LED files in the same directory.
Also for a given action, be sure the base filename is the same (eg: FOO.MTN, FOO.WAV, FOO.LED). The name of the .ACT file can be anything, but I recommend using the same naming convention (eg: FOO.ACT).

For a detailed example, see the Bender source and other <A HREF="../rcode/index.html">Rcode examples</A>.
<P></P>
If you can't open a .MTN file created with AEditor23 into the Action Composer, then the position name may be invalid (please email me for help).

<H3>Using both the Action Composer and AEditor</H3>
It is pretty simple. Just use one editor at a time.
Save all your work before switching to the other editor.
<BR>
The Action Composer editors are good for setting up the structure of your project, for editing MIDI music, flashing LED files, and limited WAV file editing.
The Action Composer motion editor is good most basic motion editing, as long as you don't have too many key frames.
<BR>
The AEditor23 editor is good for general editing, and especially good at matching motions and LED flashing to a WAV file.
<BR>
For more advanced WAV file editing, I recommend CoolEdit.
<BR>
Experiment to find out what is the best mix of editing tools for your particular habits.

<HR>
<H2>Platforms</H2>
AEditor is a Win32 program. It should work on Windows 95 and above. It requires DirectX for the 3D Virtual AIBO.
<br>
The file VIRTAIBO2.DLL must be in the same directory as the main program.
<P></P>

<HR>
<H2>Virtual AIBO</H2>
The main tool for viewing and editing AIBO performances is Virtual Aibo. Virtual AIBO is a 3D model of the AIBO that is used for playback and editing of motions.
<br>
<A HREF="virtaibo.htm">Click here for more information on Virtual AIBO.</A><br>
<P></P>

<HR>
<H2>Basic Concepts</H2>
With the editor you are editing one, two or three files at once. The root file name must be the same and the files must be in the same directory.
For example you can be editing the "SKIT1" performance, with the audio in SKIT1.WAV, the motion in SKIT1.MTN and the eye flashing in SKIT1.LED.
<br>
You can examine built-in Action (File / Open Action) but you can not change them. You can preview them and possibly copy motion tracks from them. The built-in actions are currently limited to ERS-111 performances only.
<br>
Virtual AIBO can be used to playback performances, and to edit joint values.
<br>
The "Generate Mouth" and "Generate Eyes" commands work with a WAVE file audio, generating mouth motion or eye flashing based on the sound in the sound file. You can adjust the thresholds used for the generation algorithm.
You can also tweek the final results.

<H3>Selection</H3>
There are three kinds of selection using the mouse.
<br>
If you use the left button of the mouse and select a region, all motion tracks will be selected.
This allows you to specify a time range.
The audio track is hilited, even though you can't change the audio data.
<br>
If you hold down the SHIFT key when you select a range with the left mouse button, you will get a "2 Dimensional" selection. This will select both the time range and those tracks you want to change.
This is primarily used to select specific tracks to smooth or perform other operations on.
<br>
Finally, the RIGHT mouse button is used to directly edit values. This works for motion tracks and LED tracks.
