<H2>Usage instructions</H2>

<H3>Who are the Cylons?</H3>

The cylons are a race of robots- they destroyed their creators, and then tried to do the same to the human race. They almost succeeded, except for the Battlestar Galactica, and a few ship- who went off in search of the planet earth (for more information do a search for Battlestar Galactica

<P></P>
<H3>General information about personality</H3>

Cylon is pretty active, He should wander around a lot, shooting everything, and threatening every human he finds. He will occasionally rest- this is the ideal time to give him verbal commands (all YART verbal commands have a specific response)


<P></P>
<H3>Specific commands/ actions</H3>
<LI>Taking a photo- is a two-stage process. First press the head button and he will sit, and then confirm you want a picture taken. When you release the head button he will take a photo, and tell you he is finished. You can also use the voice command "Take a picture" 

<LI>Battlestar Galactica theme tune- if you like the boot up theme tune, ask Cylon to 'sing' at any time for a repeat performance. 

<LI>Paws- would you touch a cylons feet?

<LI>Obedient-As with any Cylon if you give him a command (turn left, walk forward etc) he will respond with BY YOUR COMMAND, perform the command, then tell you he is done

<LI>Name/ Owner Registration- You can record a name and owner as usual- however you cannot own a Cylon (they are loyal to the Imperial Leader). If you ask him who his owner is he will respond accordingly

<P></P>
<HR>

<H2>Enhanced ERS-220 version</H2>
The new and improved ERS-220 version has many
many ERS 220 ONLY features.
It makes extensive use of the 220 hardware, including the LEDs and the headlight.
It also includes some new sounds, actions and a new boot routine (best viewed in a dark room).
Many of the verbal commands have also been changed.

<P>Enhanced features:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Longer Boot routine: Cylon now performs a longer boot routine. He starts by quoting a very famous Battlestar Galactica speech.
This can be repeated by saying "say a message".
<BR>
He will then sing the battlestar galactica theme tune (it is suggested this is done in complete darkness).
This can be repeated by saying "sing a song".
<LI>Back buttons: (left, right and center) can now be used to direct cylon.
<BR>
If you press the main back button, cylon will sit down and remain still until you flick his head antenna).
<LI>Head antenna: if you flick (and release) the head antenna cylon will take a photo.
He will use his headlight to illuminate his subject.
<LI>Eye swipe: when cylon scans, he will perform an eye swipe.
His headlight will also be illuminated while scanning 
<LI>New actions: several new 2x0 actions have been included.
For example say "Pose for me"

</UL>
<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Customization</H2>

You can customize the personality using YART.
To run YART on the personality, just open the "\CUSTOM" folder on the memory stick and run the YART.EXE program in there.
<P></P>
Please refer to the general <A HREF="../rcode/yart.htm">YART tutorial</A> if you have never used YART before.
