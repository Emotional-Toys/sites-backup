<H2>Usage instructions</H2>

<H3>Who is K9</H3>
K9 was a robotic dog (possibly the first)- he was an assistant to the fourth Doctor (played by Tom Baker), he functioned as a mobile computer and defence system.
<BR>
K9 joined the Doctor when his original owner, Professor Marius, was unable to bring him back to Earth due to luggage limits. K9 Mk I stayed with Leela on Gallifrey, the Doctor produced K9 Mk II, which remained in E-Space with Romana. K9 Mk III was a gift from the Doctor to Sarah Jane Smith. 
<BR>He went on to make his own tv series (called K9 and friends)- which wasn’t very successful

<P></P>

<H3>General information about personality</H3>

The K9 personality is pretty active- he will do a lot of walking and talking (occasionally to his self). He is very polite- and will usually call you 'master', although can occasionally get confused and call you 'mistress'.
He is also a mimic- occasionally he will use a dalek voice, at other times he will use AIBO tones.
<P></P>
He has been programmed to wander and explore on his own, and so may not appear to listen to you straight a way- but will eventually obey your verbal commands.
<P></P>

<H3>Specific commands/ actions</H3>

<LI>Taking a photo- is a two-stage process.
First press the head button and he will confirm you want a picture taken.
When you release the head button he will command what ever he sees to remain still, and quickly take a photo.
You can also use the voice command "Take a picture"
<LI>Pee- (something the original K9 never needed to do)- press the back button.
<LI>Dr Who theme tune- if you like the boot up theme tune, ask K9 to 'sing' at any time for a repeat performance.
<LI>Paws- The original K9 didn't have legs- so the paw sensors have been deactivated
<LI>Interaction/ Autonomy- K9 likes to interact, but remember was designed to be self sufficient- so if you leave him alone he will happily explore on his own.
<LI>Other voice commands- most of the voice commands have been customised- try them out to see what treats are in store
