 ABrowser23 - Main Features
</H1>
</center></td></tr></TABLE>

<HR>


ABrowser23 for the ERS-2x0 and ERS-31x
<BR>
You must use the ERS-11X browser for the original model AIBOs.
ABrowser23 works for the newer model AIBOs (ERS-210 and later).

<P></P>
The browser has many advanced features, but page will deal with the common browsing features.
<BR>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Installation</H2>
<P></P>

The AIBO Browser is installed on your PC.
It can be used to browse an actual memory stick, or "memory stick images" which are stored on your PC.
<BR>
To install:
<UL>
<LI>Download the latest Browser: <A HREF="browser23.zip">browser23.zip</A>
<LI>Unzip it to a folder on your PC (say C:\AIBO\TOOLS)
<LI>This will give you the Browser (ABrowser23.EXE) and a required DLL (virtaibo2.dll) which must be in the same directory.
</UL>

<HR>
<H2>Startup</H2>
<P></P>

When you run the Browser, it will search for the first drive with a memory stick image on it.
You can abort this process and manually pick the drive you want to examine.
You must open a "MEMSTICK.IND" file at the root of the proper memory stick (or memory stick image).
If you do not see a "MEMSTICK.IND" file, you may need to make hidden files visible in Windows (see "Tools", "Folder Options" and the "View" tab).
<P></P>

<HR>
<H2>Main Interface</H2>
<P></P>

<BR><IMG SRC="ss_brow3.jpg"><BR>
<P></P>
The main interface has 3 lists. The first list is the "File" to browse (note: not all of these are actual files). Pick which "File" to browse, and the second and third list will fill in with the appropriate data.
<BR>
Click around on anything of interest. Sometimes double-clicking on an item will cause it to be played back. Sometimes you need to press the "Play" button on the bottom.


<HR>
<H2>Summary Page</H2>
<P></P>
This gives a summary of the current status of your AIBO.
<BR>
Most of the information given in the summary page is also provided by the main "Examine" feature of <A HREF="../123/aibotool.htm">AiboTool</A>.

<HR>
<H2>Photos (ERS-210 and AiboLife 1 only)</H2>
<P></P>
<BR><IMG SRC="ss_brow2.jpg"><BR>

If you have AiboLife (W01) running on the ERS-210, you can take pictures by saying "Take a picture".
The picture is stored on the memory stick in a non-standard format.
You can use the APH2BMP utility to convert it to a .BMP, or use the Browser to display the image on your screen.
The memory stick will hold at most 7 photographs.
Select the "on memory stick" item in the browser to see the photos on the memory stick. Click on one of the Photos to see the photo and other information about your AIBO at the time the photo was taken.

<H3>"on PC"</H3>
The memory stick can only hold 7 photographs. When the 8th is taken, the oldest .APH file will be deleted.
To save photographs, you will need to copy them to your PC.
Create a "PHOTOS" folder on your PC (the "PHOTOS" folder must be in the same folder as ABrowser23.exe).
Copy any APH files you like to the PHOTOS directory. Rename the files as necessary, but keep the .APH file extension.

<H3>Warning for Fun Pack owners</H3>
If you have the Sony Fun Pack, and you wish to use the Browser to view your photographs -- be sure to view and copy the .APH files <i>before</i> running the Fun Pack.
When the Fun Pack starts, it will take the .APH files off the memory stick, save them away in the Fun Pack database, and then <i>delete</i> the .APH files.
Once inside the Fun Pack, the photos can not be restored to .APH format.

<HR>
<H2>"rhapsody" File</H2>
<P></P>

<BR><IMG SRC="ss_brow3.jpg"><BR>

<P></P>
The "rhapsody" file gives detailed information about quality time as well as counts of key events in your AIBO's life.
These counts get reset to zero when AIBO evolves to a new stage.
Non-zero counts are listed for things that your AIBO has already done.
Zero counts indicate things your AIBO has never done (at least not at this stage).

<P></P>
The general rule for raising AIBO is to keep counts of good events higher than counts of bad events.
Examples of good events include: seeing the BALL or FAVorite color, being praised, being greeted ("Hello AIBO").
Examples of bad events include: seeing the UNFAV (hated) color, being hit or being bossed around ("Sit down").

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Brain Surgery</H2>

<BR><IMG SRC="ss_brow4.jpg"><BR>

<P></P>
Brain Surgery lets you change the stage and personality of your AIBO.

<HR>
<H2>User ODA Files</H2>
<P></P>
<BR><IMG SRC="ss_brow5.jpg"><BR>

<P></P>
You can browse the "user" ODA files directly from the memory stick.
These files will not exist on the AiboLife stick (unless you have the Fun Pack) or the Hello AIBO stick.

<BR>
Select a Motion, Sound or LED performance and press "Play" to see/hear the performance. For LED performances, they are played as musical tunes.

<P></P>
<HR>
<HR>
<H2>Examine Color Preferences</H2>
<P></P>
From the "View" menu, you can view the current color preferences of your AIBO.
You can use AiboTool to change the color preferences.
