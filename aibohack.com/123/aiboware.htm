This lists all the officially released AiboWare versions (most from Sony).
<BR>
Prices are in US dollars. Japanese prices are typically lower.
A $90 stick in the US costs 9000 Yen in Japan (close to $75 at current exchange rates).
<BR>
<P></P>
See <A HREF="../2or3/perscompare.htm">this page</A> for a more technical analysis of the personalities and their complexity.
<P></P>
Recommendations and opinions on what to buy are my own.

<H1>ERS-110/111 AiboWare</H1>
</center></td></tr> </TABLE>
<HR>

ERS-11x AiboWare will work in the ERS-110 and ERS-111 dogs.
It can be copied to any 8MB or 16MB memory stick.
It is not copy protected.
ERS-11x AiboWare is no longer being updated.

<P></P>
<H2>Core AiboWare (11x)</H2>
The core AiboWare grows up from a newborn to an adult.
You did not have to purchase it separately since it that came with the robot hardware.
This is like the "AiboLife" software used in later model robots (210 and later) which is sold separately from the hardware.

<P></P>
There are three released versions of the core AiboWare for the 110/111:
<UL>
<LI>ERA-110 - original AiboWare for the ERS-110
<LI>ERA-111 "A" - AiboWare for the first batch ERS-111s
<LI>ERA-111 "B" - updated AiboWare for the second batch of ERS-111s
</UL>
<P></P>
The recommended AiboWare is version ERS-111 "B". It has the most bug fixes and is slightly easier to train than the "A" version.
You can download backup copies from <A HREF=http://www.aibosite.com>AiboSite</A>.
Look under "Downloads" for "110 Virgin Memory Stick Images" (typically use the ERS-111B stick).
<P></P>

<H2>Optional AiboWare (11x)</H2>

There are three additional 11x AiboWare titles that are sold (or given away).
<UL>
<LI>ERA-101 - "Hello AIBO" a demo personality (approx $90)
<LI>ERA-102M - "Party Mascot" ($90)
<LI>IP-0002J - Let's Play / Card Dog - a card playing personality that comes with a special set of cards (Japanese only, approx. $150)
</UL>

Stick images of these software titles are not available on the Internet.
The "Hello AIBO" stick is sold in Japan. It was given away as a promotional item in the US and UK for a limited period of time.

<P></P>
<HR>
<TABLE width=100% border=1 bgcolor="#C0C0C0"><tr><td><center>
<H1>ERS-210 AiboWare</H1>
</center></td></tr> </TABLE>
<HR>

There are many versions of AiboWare for the ERS-210.
<BR>
Each version of AiboWare has its own unique memory stick encryption key.
You must purchase the proper red memory stick to use that version of AiboWare.
<BR>
Most AiboWare comes in two languages (English and Japanese).
AiboLife 1 and Hello AIBO (Type-A) are available in 4 languages (English, Japanese, French and German).
Some AiboWare does not have voice commands, so language does not matter (eg: CardDog or Navigator).

<P></P>
<H2>Core AiboWare (2x0)</H2>
<P></P>

There are two main personality sticks that grow from a baby to an adult.
<UL>
<LI>AiboLife 1 "W01" (ERF-210W01E/J/F/G) ERS-210 only, $90
<LI>AiboLife 2 "W01" (ERF-210W01E/J) ERS-210 and 220 only, $90
</UL>

I recommend every AIBO owner have at least one AiboLife stick.
ERS-220 owners should buy AiboLife 2.
ERS-210 owners should buy AiboLife 1 and optionally AiboLife 2 as well (giving two different personalities).

<P></P>
Another core memory stick you should own is a $34 "Programmable Memory Stick", sometimes called a "PMS" or "RCODE" or "AMS" stick.

<P></P>
In comparison to the depth and complexity of the $90 "AiboLife" sticks, and the general usability of the $34 RCODE sticks, the other titles do not have the same depth or value.
Therefore I consider them all "optional" depending on your interests, and your pocketbook.
None of them are terrible, but when paying $90 to $150 for a stick, I have high expectations.

<P></P>
<H2>Optional AiboWare (210)</H2>
<P></P>

(NOTE: currently for the ERS-210. Will be updated with 220 compatibility information later)
<UL>
<LI>Hello AIBO Type-A (ERF-210W02E/J/F/G) ERS-210, $80
<DIR>
Hello AIBO (Type-A) is recommended if you do not want to spend time raising your AIBO from a newborn.
It acts like AiboLife but comes as a fixed personality adult ("Gentle Adult").
If you are comfortable performing "Brain Surgery", using the main AiboLife stick is recommended.
</DIR>
<LI>Party Mascot (ERF-210W03E/J) ERS-210, $80
<DIR>
Party Mascot has a few interesting games.
It is more of a curiosity than a stick you will frequently use.
</DIR>
</UL>

<BR>

<P></P>
<H2>Optional LAN related AiboWare (210)</H2>
<P></P>
If you own the AIBO LAN setup, there are several additional AiboWare titles you should investigate.
These products come with a pink memory stick containing the AiboWare and a CDROM to install the PC software.
A PC running Windows is required.

<UL>
<LI>AIBO Messenger (ERF-210W04E/J), $150
<DIR>
Email and web page reading AIBO.
Requires PC and LAN.
</DIR>
<LI>AIBO Navigator (ERF-210W05E/J), $150
<DIR>
Remote control AIBO (requires PC and LAN).
AIBO Navigator 2 to be released soon.
</DIR>
</UL>

<P></P>
These are all good products, and focus on one aspect of the robot.
The only negative is the price. $150 is a very expensive price for software, and the functionality isn't that new.
For more information, check the main <A HREF=http://www.aibo.com>www.aibo.com</A> site.

The Latte and Macaron puppies have a limited number of AiboWare titles.
Fortunately RCODE programs can run on the puppies to add to their capabilities.

<P></P>
<H2>Core AiboWare (31x)</H2>
<P></P>

<UL>
<LI>AiboLife 310 (ERF-310W01E/J) ERS-31x only, $90
<LI>AiboPal 310 "E" (ERF-310W07E) ERS-31x only, $90
<LI>AiboPal 310 "J" (ERF-310W06J) ERS-31x only (Japan only)
</UL>

<P></P>
Both sticks are recommended.
Another core memory stick you should own is a $34 "Programmable Memory Stick", sometimes called a "PMS" or "RCODE" or "AMS" stick.
This stick is the same as used in the 210 and 220 models.
<P></P>
The Japanese AiboPal ("W06J") has two distinct personalities, depending on whether you run it in Latte (white skin) or Macaron (black skin).
The English AiboPal ("W07J") is color blind.
