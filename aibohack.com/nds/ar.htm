<H2>The Action Replay MAX DUO Works!!!</H2>

The $35 Action Replay Max DUO made by Datel does work with the AC:WW game.
It has been discontinued but can be found on eBay.
It has both a DS and GBA slot, and can backup and restore gamesaves (AKA "powersaves").
<BR>
<B>DO NOT BUY THE newer/cheaper "Action Replay DS" (no DUO), it doesn't support gamesaves.
</B>
At least don't buy it alone.
If you buy both models you can try the <A HREF="ac_ards.htm">advanced "next generation" tricks</A>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="which_ar.jpg">
</CENTER>

<P></P>
There are two versions of the MAX DUO hardware:
<BR>
If you buy a recently manufactured unit, it should work right out of the box (version 1.05C firmware, and pins 4 and 5 already soldered for you).
If you buy online from the Datel (codejunkies.com) website, it will come presoldered.
<BR>
If it doesn't work you have an older unit (even if it has the 1.05 firmware).
You can perform the simple hardware mod yourself, soldering two pins inside the Action Replay unit.
Many thanks to "Y.S." for pointing this out.
<P></P>
If you recently purchased the Action Replay (within last 90 days) and it is an old unit, you may be able to return it and get a new unit (with the pins soldered together).

<P></P>
<H3>You should already have:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>A Nintendo DS console (no hardware mods required)
<LI>The NDS game "Animal Crossing:Wild World" (or the Japanese version 
"Oideyo Dobutsu no Mori").
<LI>If needed: A soldering iron and some familarity with soldering small things
</UL>
<H3>PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!</H3>
<P></P>

<DIR>
Please read the instructions that come with the Action Replay. They can be confusing.
You only need the "MAX DRIVE DS" features. You are not using the Action Replay code feature (which is for GBA games).
<BR>
<B>Please don't email me with general Action Replay problems.</B>
If you have problems with the USB cable, try and try again until you find the right combination and boot order. Read the instruction manual.
<P></P>
If you have never used the Action Replay before for DS game saves, I recommend trying the hardware using another (older) NDS game first.
</DIR>


<A name=BUY>
<H2>Step#1: What to buy</H2>
<UL>
<LI>A $35 "Action Replay DS/GBA Max DUO"
<BR>
<B>BE SURE IT HAS "DUO" IN THE NAME</B>
Search the eBay for "Action Replay MAX DUO" and be sure it has a GBA slot ($35 retail price).
<BR>
It has been discontinued, so you can't buy it from Datel or normal online retailers.
<BR>
If you get the proper "DUO" unit, it may require soldering.
Take apart the unit (remove 4 small screws) to see if it has a solder bridge like in the photo below
(new units come pre-soldered).
If you don't want to solder it, returning to Datel for a newer unit is recommended.
I don't recommend using aluminum foil, but that's up to you.
<BR>
You will not be using the "codes" feature.
You will use the Action Replay to backup the gamesave, transfer it to the PC and edit it there.
<BR>
An install disc and a USB transfer cable should come with Action Replay unit
<P></P>
<LI>You <B>also</B> need a GBA game cartridge (any GBA game with the large connector). If you don't have an old game laying around, you can buy second hand games cheap (under $5).
</UL>
<P></P>

<P></P>
<H2>Step#2: test it out</H2>
Install the software that comes with the Action Replay (on a small CD perhaps stuck inside the manual).
Read the instructions that come with the Action Replay. They can be confusing.
<H3>Make a backup to your PC of the AC:WW game.</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Insert the AC:WW game into the "DS" slot of the Action Replay
<LI>Insert a GBA game in the "GBA" slot of the Action Replay (any GBA game, it won't work without it)
<LI>Connect the USB cable between the Action Replay and the PC
<LI>Insert the Action Replay into the GBA slot of your NDS console
<LI>Leave the switch in the DS position!

<LI>Turn on the console and boot the GBA game. Hold down the Left shoulder buttons to force USB mode.
<LI>You should see the "GameBoy" logo appear first (if not try again or check cartridge connections)
<LI>The Action Replay should in "USB Server Mode"
<P></P>
<LI>On your PC, run the "Nintendo DS - GBA Max Drive" program that you installed previously.
<LI>
For which device to manage, pick "Max Drive DS (DS)".
Then pick "Backup my game cart save".
Then select "My PC database" and press "Next =>".
Enter the game name (suggestion "ac" or "acww") and the save name (suggestion "test1").
<LI>Press "Next =>".
<P></P>
<LI>If you get the error "Game Cart not present, please insert before continuing" then the Action Replay does not understand the game in the DS slot. Go to the next step.
<LI>If you see the message "Warning! - Expected Flash version 1.02 but got 1.04 please make sure your console flash is upto date." - press OK and ignore it.
<LI>If it starts the download process, it will take around 2 or 3 minutes to backup the game cartridge. If it successfully finished, skip to Step#5.
You are lucky and don't need to do any modifications to the Action Replay unit.
<LI>If you get other problems, it is typically the USB setup. Please read the manual, and try again.
Test it first with an older NDS game (anything except MarioKart or AC:WW).
</OL>
<P></P>
If it does work for the AC:WW cartridge, jump to Step#5.

<P></P>
<A name=STEP3>
<H2>Step#3: Update firmware</H2>
NOTE: updating the firmware is not necessary. If your Action Replay fails Step#2, you must perform the solder modification.
Currently the latest English firmware is version 1.06.
Earlier versions should work as well (if before 1.04 you should upgrade for the compress/recompress feature)
<BR>
Please go to
<A HREF="http://us.codejunkies.com/support/support_product.aspx?prodID=22">
this page at the codejunkies.com website</A> for software/firmware updates.
<P></P>

<H2>Step#4: solder fix (for old units)</H2>
<LI>The following solder modification is not officially supported by anyone.
If you break your unit, don't blame me.
PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.
<BR>
NOTE: Newer manufactured Action Replays come with the two pins already soldered together.
<UL>
<LI>Take the Action Replay unit apart (4 small screws).
<LI>Solder together pins 4 and 5 of the DS socket
<LI>Put the unit back together
<LI>Repeat the test you did in Step#2. It should work now. If not please, please check your soldering job and general USB connections.
</UL>

Many thanks to "Y.S." for this great discovery!
<P></P>
<H2>Step#5: save that backup</H2>
Action Replay will save your backup as a compressed .dst file
(If you saved it to file "test1", it will be in the actual file
"?:\Program Files\Datel\Nintendo DS - GBA Max Drive\PC\test1.dst").
It will typically be 50 to 100KB in size.
Make a backup copy of this file. Do not alter it. Do not lose it.
This is a copy of your town data before you did any modifications.
You may need this later.
<P></P>
<H2>Step#6: Get started with the Map Editor</H2>
<P></P>
Once you have a working backup and know the process, you can follow the regular <A HREF="ac_mapedit.htm">map editor instructions</A>.
Follow the instructions for "Action Replay Users" which includes the necessary decompression and recompression steps.
