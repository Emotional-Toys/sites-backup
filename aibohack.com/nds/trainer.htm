<BR>
There is a <A HREF="trainer_pc.htm">Windows program</A> that runs on your PC.
<BR>
This page describes the Homebrew version (program runs on the NDS)

<P></P>
<HR>

<H2>Hardware Requirements</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Any current version of Nintendogs (any of the three versions, English or Japanese).
<LI>Homebrew Capable Nintendo DS which includes:
<LI>"PassMe", "WiFiMe" or "FlashMe" enabling (FlashMe recommended)
<LI>Programmable GBA Cartridge to contain homebrew program (any size, with or without SRAM)
<LI>Way of downloading program to homebrew cartridge (typically a GBA downloader)
<LI>Optional: Way of uploading SRAM contents - to store game saves on your PC
</UL>

NOTE: if you have run NDS homebrew games/apps, you should already have the required hardware.
If you have not run NDS homebrew before, then you should stop right here.

<P></P>
NOTE: If you don't have a full homebrew setup, but you do have a way to backup your gamesave to your PC, try the <A HREF="trainer_pc.htm">PC program, Nintendogs Trainer for Windows</A>.
<P></P>

<H2>Trainer Features</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Backup entire game state SRAM (GBA Cart with SRAM required) to save on your PC
<LI>Restore entire game state
<LI>Import a dog from a friend's cartridge. Unlike "Bark Mode" this gives you a complete clone of your friend's dog without harming the original.
<P></P>

<LI>Easily add money or trainer points (become a stinking rich "Dog Master" in seconds)
<LI>Quicky switch the room style (for free, no waiting for the interior designer)
<LI>Reports number of items you've found, and how many you are missing

<LI>Easily add all the puppy breeds (20 regular ones)
<LI>NOTE: All objects/items available with any version of Nintendogs Cartridge.
<P></P>
<LI>Tweek the attributes of any of your dogs:
<LI>Breed - change the breed to any of the 20 available breeds (and two special Japanese breeds)
<LI>Gender - quick sex-change
<LI>Color - change color (depends on breed)
<LI>Size - make dogs larger or smaller (or invisible or outrageously big)
<LI>NOTE: you can edit any of your dogs (active or in hotel, max of 8)
<LI>Advanced: tweek the learned tricks. Replace and existing voice command with another trick (including tricks you normally can't train the dog to do)
<BR>

</UL>

<H2>Installation/Usage Instructions</H2>

<DIR><B>
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
</B>
<BR>
WARNING: backup your Nintendogs game save before doing any significant editing.
Backup to SRAM is supported by this trainer. If you don't have SRAM on your GBA cartridge, look for another backup utility.
</DIR>

<UL>
<LI>Download the beta test version <A HREF="trainer01.zip">trainer01.zip</A>. Includes a .gba and .nds packaged version
<BR>
NOTE: there are trojan programs floating around that can brick your NDS. Only download programs from trusted sources. Using "FlashMe" is safer. Be sure to get FlashMe from a trusted source.
<LI>Install the proper version on your GBA cart. Exact details will depend on your Homebrew GBA cart.
<P></P>

<LI>Insert your Homebrew GBA cart into the GBA slot of the DS console.
<LI>Insert your Nintendogs DS cart into the NDS slot of the DS console.
<LI>Turn on your DS console and run the Homebrew app (with RunMe/FlashMe or with the WifiMe boot process)
<LI>It should load the Nintendogs game save and report the status of the game on the upper screen.
<LI>If it fails to load, please send me an email (dspet@aibohack.com)
</UL>

<P>General User Interface Rules</P>
<UL>
<LI>Both screens are used.
<LI>Info usually appears in the upper screen.
<LI>The user interface is displayed on the lower screen.
When picking from a list, you can use the UP/DOWN buttons or the stylus to select.
To activate your selection, press the "A" button. To cancel press "B".
<LI>Before any dangerous operation you must press "Trigger L" followed by "Trigger R".
<LI>Most operations change the trainer working copy in RAM.
Changes will not be written to the Nintendogs cart unless you pick "Write to NDS Cart" and confirm (with Trigger L + Trigger R).
<LI>After saving your changes, you should turn of the DS console. Then turn it on and run the Nintendogs game.
If you are using "FlashMe" you should hold the SELECT button to prevent the homebrew app from running (or remove the GBA cart).
<LI>The user interface is English only. Japanese characters in dog names are shown as "?". The dog breed should help you identify multiple dogs.
</UL>
<P></P>

<P>Specific Commands</P>
<UL>
<LI>"Load NDS cart data" - start over. Reload game save from Nintendogs cart to the trainer for editing (this is done automatically when the program starts)
<LI>"Edit Owner Info" - change global settings, add $$ or training points.
<LI>"Edit Dog Info" - pick which dog first, then you can edit the dog's breed, color, size or tricks (see below for warning)
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>"Change Breed" - will change the breed (the two "J Beagle" breeds are leftover from the J version). Color may not work. If you have problems change color to "Color Zero"
<LI>"Change Gender" - Male (not a bitch) or Female (bitch)
<LI>"Change Color" - change the color index.
<BR>
WARNING: not all color combinations will work with all breeds.
If you pick a color not supported by the dog's breed, Nintendogs will fail to boot. If that happens, restart the homebrew trainer, and change the color to a lower number. "Color Zero" will work for all breeds.
<LI>"Change Size" - change dog size. Only multiples of 1000 are supported. 1 (1000) is small, 2 or 3 is regular Chiuaua size, 4 or 5 is regular Boxer size.
Larger sizes eventually will fill the room. Size of zero will make the dog invisible.
<LI>"Edit Tricks" - To be documented (NOTE: some trick names are incorrect)
</UL>
<P></P>
<LI>"Edit Item Info" - look at the top screen and it will report what you have found. If you are tired of walking the dog, you can add the missing items magically.
Add missing objects will add one of each item, or ten if the item is perishable.
<LI>"Write to NDS cart" - use this to write your changes to the Nintendogs cart.
<LI>REMEMBER: Changes will not be written to the Nintendogs cart unless you pick "Write to NDS Cart" and confirm (with Trigger L + Trigger R).
<P></P>
<LI>"Save Backup to SRAM" - compresses the Nintendogs game save and saves it to the SRAM of the GBA cart.
Save the backup to your PC (details depend on your homebrew setup).
<LI>"Load Backup from SRAM" - reverse of the Backup. Restore backup to trainer. Use "Write to NDS cart" to write the backup to the Nintendogs cart.
<LI>"Import Dog" - import a single dog from one Nintendogs cart to another (unlike Bark mode, you are making a full clone of the dog)
<LI>"Wipe NDS cart" - DANGER ADVANCED - wipes out NDS cart and start from scratch (confirm Trigger L + Trigger R twice - and it will write to the Nintendogs cart)
</UL>
