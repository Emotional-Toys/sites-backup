To use the map editor, you need the Action Replay <B>Max DUO</B> made by Datel.
It has been discontinued (but sometimes can be found on eBay).
It has both a DS and GBA slot, and can backup and restore gamesaves (AKA "powersaves").
<BR>
The newer/cheaper "Action Replay DS" (no DUO), doesn't support gamesaves or the map editor. You can use 'cheat codes' for common things like lots of bells or creating special items.

<H2>Overview - what is the map editor ?</H2>
The map editor is a Windows program that edits the gamesave of the Nintendo DS game "Animal Crossing:Wild World" (or the Japanese version "Oideyo Dobutsu no Mori").
<P></P>
If you have a Homebrew NDS you can use my <A HREF="ac_trainer2.htm">Trainer NDS app</A> or a backup tool like ETool or RAIN.
If you have an Action Replay you may be able to update it or modify it to work with the AC:WW game <A HREF="ar.htm">Click Here for more details.</A>.
<P></P>
With the map editor, you can customize your inventory, or add additional money ('Bells').
You can customize the world map, placing rocks or trees wherever you want.
Also you can leave items laying around to pickup later.
You can customize the rooms of your house in traditional and not-so-traditional ways.


<P></P>

<BR>
<B>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</B>
<BR>
NOTE: Keep an original backup of your game save in a safe place.
If you go crazy with the editor you can always go back to the backup layout.
<P></P>

<H2>Hardware Requirements</H2>

<A name=HOWTO>
<H2>How to use it with Action Replay DUO (not the newer "Action Replay DS")</H2>
If you have an Action Replay, follow these instructions:
<BR>
NOTE: be sure you have already tested the AC:WW game with your action replay, done any necessary modifications, and made a backup copy of your gamesave.

<UL>
<LI>Get a current backup of the game (if you don't have one already in your "PC Vault")
<A HREF="arhelp.htm#BACKUP">ClickHere</A> for a reminder of the steps.
<LI>Using the Action Replay software. Decompress it to a .DUC file (eg: "test1.duc").
<A HREF="arhelp.htm#UNCOMPRESS">ClickHere</A> for a reminder of the steps.
<LI>I recommend renaming saving a backup copy of the file. That's the last known working version. You may want to use it later.
<P></P>
<LI>Double click on the Map Editor program (AnimalMap.EXE) to run it.
<LI>Select a game save to open. This must be a valid Animal Crossing game save (English or Japanese version).
For Action Replay open the .DUC file (eg: "test1.duc")
<LI>Perform the desired editing operations described below.
<LI>When done, press the "FINAL SAVE" button. It will replace the file with the changes you have made (in this case "test1.duc")
<P></P>
<LI>Using the Action Replay software. Import the new DUC file to your PC Vault.
<A HREF="arhelp.htm#COMPRESS">Click Here</A> for a reminder of the steps.
<LI>Using the Action Replay software. Restore the new gamesave to the cartridge.
<A HREF="arhelp.htm#RESTORE">Click Here</A> for a reminder of the steps.
<LI>When complete, turn off the NDS console. Remove the Action Replay unit.
<LI>Remove the AC:WW game cartridge from the Action Replay unit. Stick it in the top of the NDS console like normal. Start up the NDS console.
<LI>Play the game as you would normally. Changes you have made to your Inventory, cash balance ('Bells'), world map or other things should appear in the game.
<LI>If the game fails to boot, you may have made too extravagent changes (hard to do in basic editing mode, easy to do in the advanced modes).
Go back to an early backup and try again.
</UL>

<P></P>
<H3>FAQ/TIPS:</H3>
If you get an error message <B>"ERROR: bad checksum #1"</B> or
<B>"ERROR: bad checksum #2"</B> or
<B>"ERROR: mirror copies don't match"</B>, don't panic.
Nothing is wrong, the editor is being extra safe and won't let you change the game save in this state.
<BR>
There is a simple work around.
It takes a little longer during the initial backup - but not as long as re-running the Action Replay download process.
<BR>
Before doing the AR backup step, quit the game and save ("Save and end.")
the first time, as you would normally.
Then start the game again ("Continue" from the title screen, pick the same player).
Wait until the town is prepared ("Preparations Complete") and you walk out the front door.
Immediately quit the game and save ("Save and end.") a second time.
<BR>
Then do the Action Replay backup process.
<P></P>
Action Replay can be flakey.
<B>"The console is not connected"</B> message is very common.
Follow the advice in the AR manual, and the information on this website, including the <A HREF="arhelp.htm">AR Help page</A>.
<P></P>
The AR socket may not fit snuggly.
Try re-inserting the AR unit into the NDS slot or jiggle it.
You should be able to get it to boot in regular mode (don't hold the L/Left 
shoulder button) and backup the DS cartridge - space permitting.
<P></P>
If your display is 1024x768 (minimum recommended screen size), the larger dialogs may not fit on the screen. One workaround is to turn off your taskbar or make it autohide (give enough room for the very bottom).
OR you can grab the title bar and drag the entire window up (ie. so the title bar is reduced to 1 pixel at the top of the screen). That should give you enough room to see the very bottom of the dialog.

<P></P>
<H2>How to use it - Homebrew style</H2>
If you have a Homebrew NDS, you do essentially the same thing as the above.
Replace the backup and restore steps with running a gamesave backup tool like ETool, RAIN or my trainer.
Once uncompressed, the map editor will be able to edit the gamesaves.
The compressed format for my trainer is supported directly.
<BR>
The testing process of updating the gamesave is usually much faster than the Action Replay.

<H2>Other Stuff:</H2>
<A name=DEMOS>
<H3>DemoTown(s)</H3>
There are two sample gamesaves of unique custom towns showing off interesting features.
Download them <A HREF="demo_towns.zip"> here (demo_towns.zip)</A>.
If you want to play them on your NDS, you need the US version of the game.
They work best if you set the game clock to Feb 2, 2006 (avoiding weeds).
<UL>
<LI>"Simple" is a very simple standard town. The house is empty for you to decorate.
Useful for test driving the editor (ie. if you don't have an Action Replay yet)
<LI>"Marathon" is a maze map featuring monkeys. It uses super river editing to make a maze.
At the end are prizes of money trees and royal crowns.
<BR>
The Maze Challenge: <B>Find the houses of "Champ" and "Nana"</B>.
<BR>
Don't trust the mini-map. Fun to play by yourself, or open up your town to visitors. If they can find their way to the two house, they can pickup the prizes.

<A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/stars5/tkcpics2/wildworld">this external link</A>
<BR>
NOTE: The AC:WW community often uses the term "hacked" to refer to the "Mario Items" or other special items that aren't available by playing the game the regular way.
This term is misleading and applied inconsistently. All these items are built into the game.

<H3>GameShark compressed format</H3>
AnimalMap understands many of the common gamesave formats used by Action Replay and homebrew setups.
It does not understand the compressed GameShark format.
