<H2>How to tweek existing snowmen (ADVANCED)</H2>

First you should be familiar with the Action Replay (MAX/DUO), and how to use it with your AC:WW game.
Check the basic instructions in the links at the top of the page.
<P></P>
You must first create a snowman (or two or three) playing the game normally.
If necessary set your game clock to winter (early December) so the two snowballs appear on the ground.
Roll them to make them bigger and together to make a snowman.
There are many guides on the web for making a snowman, especially a perfect snowman.
For tweeking purposes, it doesn't have to be a perfect snowman.
Please don't ask me if you can't figure out how to make the most primitive snowman (if you can't figure it out you shouldn't be trying these things).
<P><P>
If you want to create two or three snowmen, advance the game ahead one day, then repeat the process. The original snowman will melt a little (and be smaller). You can fix that later.
<P><P>
Don't worry about the location, size, or perfection of these snowmen, you can change them.
<P></P>
Now follow these steps:
<UL>
<LI>Create one, two or three snowmen playing the game normally (see above)
<LI>Backup of the game so you can run the Map Editor
(see the <A HREF="ac_mapedit.htm#HOWTO">main how-to use the Action Replay</A>)
<LI>Open the gamesave
<LI>Press the "Advanced>>>" button
<LI>From the "Town" menu, pick the "Snowman Heads"
<LI>You will see one, two or three rows with 5 editable number each. These are numbers you can type in to change the attributes.
<LI>The exact details of how the number work are not known. You will need to experiment with different combinations.
Here's a rough guide (but don't quote me on any of this)
<LI>The first number is the head size. The second number is the body size. The third number has something to do with the gap between head and body.
The last two numbers are not well understood.
The first 4 numbers are normally in the range 0 to 15.
<LI>Press the "Renew" button on each of the snowmen. That will adjust the time so the snowman won't be small because of melting.
<LI>Please experiment and see if you can come up with interesting combinations.
See the photos above and the 5 numbers listed.
<LI>If you want to keep your snowmen from melting, backup and run the "Renew" command to make them full sized again.
Once they melt for good, you will have to start over (rolling two snowballs together)
<LI>Snowmen melt easily.
If the game detects you time travelling (going backwards or forward a long time), it will remove the snowmen.
Advancing the clock by one day twice (to quickly build 3 snowmen) appears to work.
Snowman will eventually disappear after winter.
These are rules of the game, not something you can change.
</UL>


<P></P>
<H2>How to move existing snowmen (ADVANCED)</H2>
<P></P>
To move the location of the snowman, use the main map editor "Edit World Map" command. There are three special terrain items for the snowmen.
Move them like you would move a building (eg: a neighbors house).
<P></P>
You can only move them. Delete the original and place it in the new location.
You can't have more than one of each kind.
You can't make them from scratch. You must roll the balls in the snow first.
You can move them anywhere, on snow, on grass, on concrete or floating over the river.
I don't know how that will influence the melting speed, but if you "Renew" them every day it shouldn't matter.
