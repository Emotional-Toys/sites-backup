 AC:WW Danger List

<HR>


There are many dangerous items that can be used in AC:WW to harm other towns.
Some are fun and not permanently harmful. Others are very dangerous and can be very harmful.
<BR>
I've ranked them in a scale from 0 to 4.
<BR>Danger Level 0 (no danger) are the items you normally find in the game (or slight variations like the Mario items).
 You can place them anywhere, and have a lot of them without worrying.
<BR>Danger Level 1 are mildly dangerous. Don't place them in your house, but you can play with them outside.
<BR>Danger Level 2 items are slightly more dangerous.
They can be used to vandelize towns in semi-permanent ways.
However with a little work the town can be cleaned up (without resorting to Action Replay).
<BR>Danger Level 3 items are dangerous.
They can be used to vandelize towns in permanent ways.
To fix a damaged town, the victim may need to buy an Action Replay (AR DUO), or restart their town from scratch.
<BR>Danger Level 4 items are dangerous.
They can be used to vandelize towns in permanent ways.
To fix a damaged town, the victim may need to buy an Action Replay (AR DUO).
In some cases they won't be able to restart their town from scratch (ie. buy another $35 cartridge, or a $35 Action Replay DUO to fix it)

<P></P>
<H3>Terrain Items in your Pockets (Commonly called 'glitched' or 'seeds')</H3>
Names like "glitched red tulip" or "mansion seeds" are misleading.
They are items that aren't meant to be in your pockets (inventory).
Having these items in your pockets when you travel to another town 
(over WiFi) can let you do tricks and damage in other towns.
I've used the 'glitched' terminology to describe some of these special items.

<H3>You don't need these dangerous items for your own town</H3>
If you have Action Replay, you should use the map editor to modify your town.
It is much more powerful than what you can do with these dangerous items.
Also you can change you mind and remove items you don't like.

<H3>Play Nice!</H3>
To see what these dangerous items do, you can drop them in your town (and if necessary clean them up).
You can play with these with a friend over WiFi (eg: you have an Action Replay, but your friend doesn't).
If you only want show off, it is best to have only one visitor, and reset the host town DS before the game is saved.
Only save the game if the host town owner wants the permanent changes.
Play nice out there!

<H3>You can sell these dangerous items - but please warn buyer</H3>
Lately it is very popular to sell dangerous seeds (including very dangerous ones not supported by the editor).
I can't stop you, but if you do plan on selling them, please warn the buyer of the issues (ie. don't drop them in your house)

<H3>Defense strategies</H3>
If you don't have an Action Replay, there are a few ways to defend your town from an evil visitor (with dangerous items in their pockets)
The best way is to only let in people you trust.
If you do see something strange going on, you can power off your game before the changes are made permanent (by a save or someone entering/leaving your town)
This is not a fool-proof defense stategy.
<BR>
Specific "CLEANUP" advice is given below to fix any problems caused by an evil visitor using danger level 1 or 2 items.
Danger level 3 or 4 items can't be cleaned up (without an Action Replay).
<BR>
The best way to protect your town is to get an Action Replay and make a backup of your current town (before someone attacks it)

<H3>General item information</H3>
When in your inventory (or drawers or recycler or lost+found) many of these dangerous items don't have a name.
When you add them using the map editor, remember where you put them.
They are all "single-use" items. Once you drop them they turn into real terrain items.
You can't pick them up again or for the items that you can pickup, the item will lose its special properties
(ie. drop a 'glitched red tulip' outside, pickup a normal 'red tulip')
When trading, you have to use the lost+found or recycler bin.
<P></P>

<HR>
<H1>The Dangerous Items</H1>

To increase the danger level in the AnimalMap editor, turn on the advanced mode and select the level from the "Danger" menu.
The program may automatically increase the danger level if you load an existing gamesave with dangerous items in it.
You can now add dangerous items to your inventory, cabinet (resident's drawers), recycler or lost+found.

<P></P>
<H2>Danger Level 1 - "glitched" flowers, weeds, trees, patterns</H2>

These are like the infamous "glitched red tulip" that was accidentally released by Nintendo. They are generally safe to use as long as you <B>DO NOT DROP THEM INSIDE YOUR HOUSE</B>

<P>TIPS:</P>
<UL>
<LI>DO NOT PLACE INSIDE YOUR HOUSE (you can't pick it up, you won't see it but it limits what furnature you can move). If you want to save it, put it inside a cabinet.
<LI>'glitched' items can be dropped on concrete or bridges, not just grass
<LI>Drop a 'glitched' item on concrete, and dig it up with a shovel. You can bury items there, or leave the hole.
<LI>When you drop a 'glitched' shrub, tree or stump, it will pop out of your pocket (full size)
<LI>When dropping a 'glitched' tree/shrub/stump, you can sometimes get stuck, preventing you from moving. Some advice
<UL>
<LI>Always carry a shovel and an axe with you (before playing around). You can sometimes chop down (and/or dig out the stump) of an offending tree.
<LI>Stand away from where you are planning to drop the item
<LI>Sometimes the axe/shovel can't help. If you are truely stuck, you need to save the game and restart it (and the trees will stay) or power off and lose it.
<LI>This is not a problem with flowers, weeds, saplings or patterns (you can walk over them)
<LI>Practice on your own town before trying over WiFi
</UL>
<LI>FUN OVER WIFI: drop unexpected items on the bridges (like flowers or patterns)
<LI>FUN OVER WIFI: drop full grown trees with fruit (especially non-native fruit, or money-trees)
<LI>FUN OVER WIFI: when visiting a well-kept town, drop weeds or parched flowers to make the town look grubby
<LI>FUN OVER WIFI: drop a bunch of parched flowers on the ground. The owner of the town can water them to see what you left them.
<LI>FUN OVER WIFI: drop a bunch of parched flowers on the ground, intermixed with a few "parched flowers (black rose - watered gold)".
If the owner of the town doesn't pull them out to get rid of them, they will be rewarded with gold roses the next day
<LI>FUN OVER WIFI: when dropping parched flowers, look carefully and you can see the color of the original for a very short time.
<LI>FUN OVER WIFI: drop a tree maze (or stump maze) in another town
<LI>FUN OVER WIFI: drop two trees (or stumps) on a bridge to block it
<LI>FUN OVER WIFI: Patterns
<UL>
<LI>Drop a pattern in the host town. Normally you can't do this when visiting another town.
<LI>Note: there are 32 patterns available, but they are the town's patterns, not yours
<LI>They are named "custom pattern X-Y", where "X" is the player number in the host town
(eg: "1" for the first resident)
and "Y" is the pattern number as seen in the Sister's store
<LI>NOTE: aim correctly. If you try to pickup your pattern after dropped it will disappear.
<LI>NOTE: if you want to use your patterns in their town, sell your pattern in the Sister's store, and get your host to buy it.
Now it will be one of their town's patterns (and you can place it, if you figure out the right number for "custom pattern X-Y"
</UL>
</UL>
<BR>
CLEANUP: Danger Level 1 items can be removed by pulling up, chopping down and/or digging out, like the normal game.

<P></P>
<H2>Danger Level 2 - "glitched" special trees, and a little mischief</H2>

Danger Level 2 includes the special trees: furniture trees, bee trees, bell trees, furniture tree, bee cedar, bell cedar and festive tree (XMas tree).
See all the warnings under Danger Level 1 for dropping trees.
<BR>
They are slightly more dangerous if you place too many of them in one part of the town. In this case the game will not boot the next day.
<BR>
<P>TIPS:</P>
<UL>
<LI>FUN OVER WIFI: drop a variety of special trees.
Drop a bee tree and the host player won't be able to shake it while you are there.
If they try to chop it down when you leave, the bees will attack.
</UL>
<BR>
CLEANUP: if a visitor comes to your town and plants too many special trees, there is a chance the game will not boot (it will hang during preparing town).
Turn it off and on again. Set the game clock back one day (or to the last day you played the game).
Start the game and it should boot now (assuming you got the date right). Now chop down all the special trees that were added. Save the game.
Restart the game, set the clock to the real date, and you can continue playing.
<P></P>

Also in Danger Level 2 are two relatively safe "mischief" items.
<UL>
<LI>The "glitched parched Rafflesia" can be dropped like other glitched flowers.
Unlike regular flowers it can't be pulled up or dug up.
It makes a semi-permanent barrier.
<LI>The "lost item" is useless and annoying. You can't sell it or recycle it.
</UL>
<BR>
CLEANUP: if a visitor has placed one or two "glitched parched Rafflesia" blocking your way,
simply Time-Travel to the future by a day or two, and it should disappear.
NOTE: the non-parched Rafflesia take longer to go away (I put them in Danger Level 3)
<BR>
CLEANUP: you can't get rid of the 'lost item' in your game by selling it or throwing it away.
Throw it in a back room of your house, or outside in the corner and forget about it, or find who gave it to you and give it back to them.
</UL>

<P></P>
<H2>Danger Level 3 - rocks in your pockets, and more mischief</H2>
Rocks (aka 'rock seeds') are dangerous and can be used for terrorism to break towns (by walling off key buildings).
There are 5 styles of rocks.
You can also drop money rocks. They will work within the limits of the game
(ie. the game will pick new money rock locations in the morning)
<P></P>
Rafflesia 'masks' and 'glitched' Rafflesia seeds are also danger level 3.
They aren't as bad a rocks and can be removed in some cases (by waiting a long time for them to go away),
assuming the town doesn't have too many weeds.
The parched Rafflesia (level 2) go away faster.

<P></P>
CLEANUP: no general repair (other than Action Replay)

<P></P>
<H2>Danger Level 4 - building 'seeds' - very dangerous</H2>

See warning on the main map editor page.
'Mansion seeds' and other building seeds can be used to terrorize and break towns, similar to the "gatehouse-to-museum" trick or worse.
<BR>
The final version of the map editor (version 1.7) supports several all the dangerous 'building seeds'.
<P></P>
CLEANUP: no general repair (other than Action Replay)

<P></P>
<HR>


As always the best defense is to only let your trusted friends into your town.
Otherwise, get yourself an Action Replay to backup your town before something bad happens.
