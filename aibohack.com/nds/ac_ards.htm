See the 
<A HREF="ac_tng.htm">Next Generation Hacks Teaser page</A> for photos of
some of the tricks descibed here.
You will learn a general technique that can be used for these and many other tricks.
Great for showing off when visitors visit your town over WiFi.


<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="ac_tng3a.jpg">
</CENTER>

<P></P>
There are two different "Action Replay" devices.
<BR>
The older "AR MAX/DUO" does gamesaves, and works with the map editor in regular mode ($35, getting hard to find, order from Datel).
<BR>
The newer "AR DS" which only does in game codes (dynamic cheats/codes).
It does not do gamesaves.
It does not work with the map editor in regular mode.
<P></P>
For these hacks/tricks, you need both!
<BR>
(if you only have an "AR DS", <A HREF="ar.htm">I recommend you buy the AR MAX/DUO</A>,
but there are some dangerous ways of using it alone.
<A HREF="ac_ards.htm#ARDS_ALONE">See the bottom of this page</A> for how to).


<P></P>
<HR>
<H3>Prerequisites</H3>

Please do not skip any steps.
If you don't have all the hardware or the necessary skills, please don't waste your time.
These are advanced tricks.
You need to do your homework and learn how to use the two Action Replay devices the normal ways.
Then you can try these tricks.
<P></P>
You must have:
<UL>
<LI>Nintendo DS
<LI>AC:WW game (US, EU or updated US release). Japanese version of game is not supported.
<P></P>
<LI>"AR MAX/DUO" (Action Replay MAX for GBA/DS).
If old model it needs soldering.
<A HREF="ar.htm">Buy from Datel website</A> for pre-soldered version.
<LI>Experience using the "AR MAX/DUO" and the map editor in regular mode (see links at top of page).
<BR>NOTE: If you just bought the AR MAX/DUO, use the regular map editor modes first, gain some experience and then come back here later.
<P></P>
<LI>"AR DS" (Action Replay DS).
<LI>Experience using the "AR DS" program "Action Replay Code Manager"
<LI>Experience using the "AR DS" with codejunkies provided codes.
<LI>A little experience using the "AR DS" with custom codes does help.
<LI>Experience manually merging XML codes will help.
My tutorial includes the steps for what you need to do using NOTEPAD, but this is very easy to screw up if you've never edit these things before.
</UL>

You must have experience with both Action Replay devices.
If you lack any of these skills, do not proceed. Do not ask me for help.
These tutorials assume a certain amount of computer and Windows experience.
For example, if you don't know how to run NOTEPAD, this tutorial is not for you.
<P></P>
These are advanced tricks.
If that sounds like too much work for you, or appears too complex,
then I strongly recommend you get the $35 AR MAX/DUO alone and use the map editor.
That's as simple and safe as it gets.
And you aren't missing much.
These tricks are fun to try after you've done the basics of town customization and tried all the regular and advanced things you can do with the map editor.
<P></P>
If you are willing to proceed, please try the two following tutorials.
Do not skip the first two parts (preparation and tutorial #1).
It teaches you important things you need to know to perform the more advanced tricks.

<P></P>
<HR>
<H3>MANDATORY Preparation</H3>
<P></P>

We are going to create a custom codelist, and copy the starter 'codes' from the codejunkies website.

<OL>
<BR>You do these steps only once.
Once you have your own custom codelist for experimentation, you can reuse that same file by removing old XML cheats/codes and adding new ones.
<BR>NOTE: if you've played with AR DS custom codes already, you have your own method of editing custom codelists (XML files).
In the tutorial, we will simply use NOTEPAD.
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="ards2.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P></P>
<LI>Start the "Action Replay Code Manager" (the software that came with the "AR DS" that you installed earlier).
<BR>NOTE:
If you haven't used this program before, stop right here (and go back and read the Prerequisites section).
<LI>In the lower "MY CODELISTS" part, press the "*" button to create a new codelist.
<LI>It will create an entry called "New Codelist". Select it and rename it to
"maptest" (without the quotes)
<LI>In the upper "SUBSCRIPTIONS" part, find the version of the game you own.
There are 3 supported versions.
<UL>
<LI>from "Codejunkies US Games", "Animal Crossing: Wild World" - that's the "US Version"
<LI>from "Codejunkies US Games", "Animal Crossing: Wild World (v1.1) [...]" - that's the "US Version 1.1"
<LI>from "Codejunkies EU Games", "Animal Crossing: Wild World" - that's the "EU Version"
</UL>
<LI>Drag that from the upper "SUBSCRIPTIONS" part to the "MY CODELISTS" part and drop it on "maptest".
This process may take a while.
<LI>When complete the "maptest" codelist will have all the standard AC:WW codes for your version of the game.
<LI>Close the "Action Replay Code Manager" (IMPORTANT! it must not be running while you edit XML files)
<LI>Run NOTEPAD
<LI>Open the file "C:\Program Files\Datel\Action Replay Code Manager\local_codelists\maptest.xml" (assuming default installation location).
This is the XML file we will be editing.
<P></P>
<LI>Check that the first part of the file something like: (will be slightly different in the title name and gameid for the US 1.1 or EU versions)
<PRE>
&lt?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt
&ltcodelist&gt
	&ltname&gtmaptest&lt/name&gt
	&ltgame&gt
		&ltname&gtAnimal Crossing: Wild World&lt/name&gt
		&ltgameid&gtADME 8f7851cb&lt/gameid&gt
		&ltdate&gt2006/09/08 16:48&lt/date&gt
		&ltcheat&gt
			&ltname&gt(M)&lt/name&gt
			&ltcodes&gtmaster 00000000 023f0000 ...00000000 00000001 &lt/codes&gt
		&lt/cheat&gt
		&ltcheat&gt
			&ltname&gtDON'T ENTER YOUR BEDROOM WHEN USING CODES&lt/name&gt
		&lt/cheat&gt
</PRE>
<LI>I recommend adding new codes right below the ending &lt/cheat&gt for the BEDROOM warning. See below.

<P></P>
<LI>Optional: this file is pretty big, and editing it with NOTEPAD can be sluggish. You may choose to use another text editor, or delete any of the cheats/codes you don't plan on using.
To delete a cheat/code you must delete from the &ltcheat&gt to matching &lt/cheat&gt, or &ltfolder&gt to matching &lt/folder&gt.
Leave everything else alone. Be careful. Saving a backup is recommended.
<LI>Leave NOTEPAD running, and proceed to the next step (Tutorial #1)
</OL>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H3>MANDATORY Tutorial#1 - rock doors</H3>
<P></P>

We are going to create 3 different cheats (AR DS "codes").
The first cheat/code will make a small rock wall appear.
The second will make it disappear (like opening a rock door).
The third will turn it into weeds so you can pluck them (useful over WiFi).

<H4>Creating 3 simple cheats/codes</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Use the Map Editor (version 1.7) and load in your gamesave like normal.
<LI>Turn on "Advanced>>"
<LI>From the "AR-DS" menu, pick "Snapshot"
<LI>Run the world editor (basic mode) "Edit World Map"
<LI>Find a location on the world map to place the rock wall/door.
I recommend placing it at the edge of a bridge to block people from crossing.
<LI>Place 3 to 6 rocks to make a blocking wall/door. Do not make any other changes.
<BR>NOTE: If you don't know how to place rocks on the world map using the map editor,
stop right here (and go back and read the Prerequisites section).
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="ards3.jpg">
</CENTER>

<P>The first cheat/code (adding a wall)</P>
<LI>Press the "Save Changes" button to go back to the main dialog
<LI>From the "AR-DS" menu, pick "Make AR DS Code..."
<LI>In the "AR DS Generation dialog",
<UL>
<LI>First (#1) select the game version.
It must be the same as you picked in the Preparation phase [sorry, you must do this every time]
<LI>Next (#2) give the code a new name. In this case, type in "rock_wall" (without the quotes).
<LI>Next (#3) pick a button combo you will use later.
In this case select "Up+L".
That means holding the up direction pad, followed by a quick tap on the "L" left shoulder button.
<LI>Leave the others alone for now.
See the XML in the preview window, that's what we are going to merge into the maptest.xml file.
You don't need to understand it.
Your numbers will be different.
</UL>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ards4.jpg"></CENTER>

<LI>Press the "#5) Copy to Clipboard" button in the "AR DS Generation" dialog. Leave it running.
<LI>Switch over to NOTEPAD (where you are editing the maptest.xml file)
<LI>Click the mouse where you want to insert the new cheat/code.
I recommend adding new codes right below (after) the ending &lt/cheat&gt for the BEDROOM warning.
You can add them other places as long as the format is correct.
<LI>Paste from the clipboard (in NOTEPAD, menu Edit/Paste or CTRL+V).
<P>Second cheat/code (get rid of wall)</P>
<LI>Switch back to the "AR DS Generation" dialog of the map editor.
Leave NOTEPAD running.
<UL>
<LI>In #2, change the name to "rock_wall_open"
<LI>In #3, change the buttons to "Dwn+L"
<LI>In #4, check the "Reverse Direction" checkbox. This new code will turn the rock wall into blank space.
</UL>
<LI>Like before, press the "#5) Copy to Clipboard" button, switch over to NOTEPAD and paste in the new cheat/code into the XML file.
<LI>Switch back to the "AR DS Generation" dialog of the map editor.
<LI>Press the "#6) Done, re-Snapshot" button and go back to the main AnimalMap dialog.
<P>Last cheat/code ('tweed' the wall - turn it into weeds)</P>
<LI>Optional: From the "AR-DS" menu, pick "Snapshot" (not necessary, the snapshot was done for you, but this is a good habit to learn)
<LI>Like before, run the world editor (basic mode) "Edit World Map"
<LI>Turn your added rocks into weeds. Pick any of the weed styles you like (except lucky dried clovers) and draw on top of the rocks.
Weeds are convenient because they can be picked up (plucked) easily and disappear. Don't make any other changes.
<LI>Like before, press the "Save Changes" button to go back to the main dialog
<LI>Like before, from the "AR-DS" menu, pick "Make AR DS Code..."
<LI>This time in the "AR DS Generation dialog",
<UL>
<LI>In #2 give the code a new name. In this case "rock_wall_tweed"
<LI>In #3 use "Rgt+L" for the button combination.
</UL>

<LI>Like before, press the "#5) Copy to Clipboard" button, switch over to NOTEPAD and paste in the new cheat/code into the XML file.
<P>Wrapup</P>
<LI>We are done with our 3 new codes. Save the "maptest.xml" file in NOTEPAD and Exit the program.
<LI>Press the "#6) Done, re-Snapshot" button and go back to the main AnimalMap dialog. 
<LI>We don't need to keep any of the map editor changes.
Don't press FINAL SAVE. From the main dialog, hit the ESCAPE button, then answer Yes exit and lose changes. 
</OL>

NOTE: the AR DS code generated is specific to your game (and town layout). Don't share the XML with your friend or post on the web, since it (most likely) won't work for them. 

<H4>Using these codes (alone)</H4>
<P>After all that work, lets play the game!</P>
NOTE: this assumes your game cartridge already has the town on it (the one you used in the map editor). You don't need to use the "AR MAX/DUO" to upload the gamesave again (it hasn't changed).

<OL start=28>
<LI>Run the "Action Replay Code Manager". On the left side it should say "Waiting for DS".
<UL>
<LI>Plug the "AR DS" device into the top slot of your DS console. Plug in the cable to your computer. Turn on the DS console.
<LI>When connected, the current game lists will appear in the left hand side under "NINTENDO DS".
If this doesn't happen, check your USB cable and the "AR DS" manual for possible problems.
<LI>Select the "maptest" custom codelist on the lower right.
Expand it and grab the one game ("Animal Crossing: Wild World ...") and drag it to the "NINTENDO DS" part.
<LI>If it asks, replace the existing version of the game.
<LI>This may take some time (especially if you haven't trimmed the standard codes).
</UL>
<LI>When done, take out the "AR DS" and swap in the AC:WW game cartridge 
<BR>NOTE: if it says "unknown game", then you picked the wrong version of the codejunkies codes. Go back and try again.
<LI>On the DS touch screen, press the little checkmark.
This lets you enable the codes you want to use.
For our tutorial, you need to enable all three: "rock_wall", "rock_wall_open" and "rock_wall_tweed"
<BR>NOTE: If you don't see the codes, you screwed up the XML merge or the uploading. Go back and try again. 
<LI>Finally press the "GO" button to run the game
<LI>The AC:WW game screen should appear. Start it like normal (pick continue, then select a player)
<LI>Walk around your town like normal. Walk over to the bridge area where you added your rock wall.
<LI>On the direction pad, hold the Up button. While holding the up button, quickly tap the "L" (left) shoulder button. Then release the up  button. That's the "Up+L" combination. The rock wall appears.
<BR>NOTE: When pressing button combos, hold the necessary buttons first and quickly tap the L or R shoulder button.
To make sure you trigger the right code, the shoulder button (L or R) should be the last one pressed and the first one released. 
<LI>Try the second cheat/code, "Dwn+L", down direction button and quickly tap L shoulder button. The rock wall disappears.
<LI>Try the last cheat/code, "Rgt+L", right direction button and quickly tap L shoulder button. The rock wall turns into weeds.
</OL>

<H4>WiFi tricks (tricks and visitors)</H4>

<P>That was boring, lets do something more exciting.</P>
<OL start=37>
<LI>Use the "Up+L" combination to turn on the rock wall (this is important, rock wall must be there before anyone visits)
<LI>Now invite a friend over to your town.
<LI>Wait until they have arrived, greet them, and press the "Rgt+L" combination (the rock wall is now weeds, for you)
<LI>Invite your friend to follow you (you want to show them something cool)
<LI>Make your character walk over to the rock wall area and have your friend follow. Walk through the weeds, and beg them to follow.
<LI>The trick is you see weeds, but they see a rock wall. The visitor is blocked.
<LI>To let your visitor get through the door, pluck one of the weeds (or maybe two or three to make a big enough hole).
Do this while they are looking for maximum effect. What you see as plucking a weed, they see as plucking a rock and making it disappear.
</OL>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ac_tng2e.jpg"></CENTER>

That's it. That's the basic way of doing all the tricks!
If you've stuck through this entire tutorial, you can now experiment and do even more things.
This isn't limited to rock doors. You can impress your visitors by pluck full grown trees, walk through buildings, removing buildings and many other things.
With a little more work (described below) you can do these tricks when visiting another person's town. This is more dangerous, but lets you undo damage of certain 'seeds' (eg: remove rocks or stray buildings from their town), do more advanced town customization, even if your friend does not have an Action Replay (either model).

<HR>

<H3>Optional Tutorial#2 - bridges on and off</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Be sure your town has at least one bridge. 
<LI>Use the Map Editor (version 1.7) and load in your gamesave like normal. 
<LI>Turn on "Advanced>>" 
<LI>If you are using the EU or US 1.1 version of the game, you need to make a fake code like described in the first tutorial (at least get the first part done, so you can set the version of the game). Ignore the code you make. Not necessary for the US 1.0 version.
<LI>From the "AR-DS" menu, pick "Generate bridge codes".
It will generate the cheats/codes and copy them to the clipboard. 
<LI>Similar to the first tutorial, open the .XML file (maptest.xml) in NOTEPAD.
Click on the place to insert the new codes and paste the new cheats/codes from the clipboard.
Save the changed XML file.
<LI>Repeat the process you used in the first tutorial (run "Action Replay Code Manager"...) to upload the new codes to the "AR DS" device (plugged into your DS console) 
<LI>Take out the "AR DS" and swap in the AC:WW game cartridge 
<LI>Enable the codes you want to use. There are two for each bridge. Enable both.
They have descriptive names and button combos: 
for example: "remove bridge 1 (Right+R)" and "add bridge 1 (Right+A+R)" The "R" means the RIGHT SHOULDER BUTTON! 
<LI>If you don't see the codes, you screwed up the XML merge or the uploading. Go back and try again. 
<LI>Run the game (just like the first tutorial)
<LI>When running the game, press the correct button combination to make the bridge disappear or appear.
This is not immediate.
You must enter and exit a house before you can see the changes. 
<BR>NOTE: When pressing button combos, hold the necessary buttons first and quickly tap the L or R shoulder button.
To make sure you trigger the right code, the shoulder button (L or R) should be the last one pressed and the first one released. 
</OL>
NOTE: the AR DS code generated is specific to your game (and town layout). Don't share the XML with your friend or post on the web. It won't work in other towns. 
<H4>WiFi tricks (tricks and visitors)</H4>
When people visit your town, the state of the bridges when they enter the town is all they will see -- it won't change.
To do the invisible bridge trick follow these steps:
<OL start=13>
<LI>remove the bridge (or bridges) before they come visit using the correct button combos
<LI>Now invite a friend over to your town.
<LI>Wait until they have arrived, greet them, and press the button combos to add the bridge (or bridges) back
<LI>Your character should enter a house for a second and immediately exit
<LI>Invite your friend to follow you (you want to show them something cool)
<LI>Now walk around your town, and impress your visitor that you can walk on water (you see bridges, they see river)
</OL>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="ac_tng3a.jpg"></CENTER>

<P></P>
<HR>
<H2>Other tricks in your town (general advice)</H2>
There are many tricks you can do in your own town using the same technique you learned in the first tutorial.
<BR>
Changes in the world map are simple 16-bit values and by assigning them button combinations, you can change them in the middle of the game (dynamic).
You can change a few of them at a time.
If you have too many changes, the AR DS can slow down the game, or sometimes prevent it from booting.
<BR>
To avoid problems, try to keep the dynamic changes to the fewest changes as possible.
Take a look at the XML preview and make sure it isn't too long. 
<P></P>
For more advanced things, there is a "32-bit" option that can be used to make the codes smaller.
There is a "8-bit" option that can be used for very small changes made not using the world map editor (for example river editing/acres are 8-bit values).
You can experiment with these if you like, but please don't ask me what goes where. 

<P></P>
When playing in your own town, dynamic cheats/codes are mainly for showing off to visitors.
If you want to make changes to your town, use the map editor the regular way.

One interesting exception is adding trees and other items very close to building (inside their walls).
Normally the area around the core of a building (shown in red in the world map editor) is wiped clean at the start of the game.
This frees up space for the building to be drawn properly.
The technique you used in the tutorial can be used to put rocks or trees or othe
r things in that area, using a cheat/code.
<H4>Quick tutorial:</H4>
Just like in the first tutorial, snapshot, but this time use the "advanced world edit" editor and replace the red squares with something different.
Leave the dark red core of the building alone.
Create a code with a button combination and merge with your XML (don't FINAL SAVE).
When running the game, press the button combination and the trees/rocks will appear. 
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="ac_tng6c.jpg">
</CENTER>
 
<H3>More Fun over WiFi</H3>
Playing over WiFi allows for interesting combinations (and great ways of showing off).
Similar to the rock doors (and disappearing bridges), your view of your town can be different than the visitor's view of your town.
Once visitors arrive, you can change items in your world view and they won't see them.
"Tweeding" (a term I made up) is very useful.
If you turn a rock/tree/building into-a-weed using a dynamic AR DS cheat/code, then you can easily pluck it.
For rocks and trees, when you pluck it, the visitor
will see it disappear before their very eyes
(you see yourself plucking a weed, they see you making a rock or tree disappear).
<P></P>
For buildings, you can make them disappear, but like bridges, you (and your visitor) must enter and leave a house before you see the real effect.
Removing buildings this was is very dangerous.
If you want to try it, try removing a neighbors house (one of the 8 NPCs), not one of the public buildings.
NOTE: this is meant for showoff purposes.
Removing buildings this way can break your town.
That's why you should keep a backup of your town (AR MAX/DUO).
Even simple "AR DS" cheats/codes can easily screwup your game save if used improperly.
BTW: if you want to damage someone else's town, there are far simpler ways. 
<P></P>
Experiment and try something new.
Some dynamic codes will change things only for you, some will change for both you and the visitor immediately (for example burried pitfalls).
These are quirks of the game, so try different things. 
If you find a cool combination or new trick, please share it with others on the BBSs.

<P></P>
<HR>
<P></P>

<H2>Tricks in someone else's town</H2>
<I>Now we are talking dangerous...</I>
<BR>
All the tricks described above assume you have BOTH Action Replay devices (AR MAX/DUO and AR DS), and your visitor has none.
You are taking all the risks in your town, but you can easily fix any problems (with AR MAX/DUO).
<P></P>
It is possible to do some of these same tricks when visiting another person's town.
It requires more work, some guesswork, and it is more dangerous. The other person can't easily fix their town if something goes wrong, so please play nice.
In some cases you can help out a friend who doesn't have Action Replay, to remove items (like rocks or extra buildings) created by dangerous 'seeds'.
<P></P>
The process is very similar to the main tutorial, the problem is you don't have a .DUC file for their town.
So you must guess.
Start with one of your own .DUC files or the Simple map from
<A HREF="ac_mapedit.htm#DEMOS">the demo towns</A>.
It is best to do this while you are visiting your friends town, so you can walk around and compare.
Use the river editor to make the map look close to what their town looks like.
Roughly place the buildings where you think they go.
Being exact helps, but is not necessary.

Save that .DUC file as an approximation of your friend's town.
To make the codes, follow the basic tutorial.
Many of the tricks won't work the same way, since you are not in your own town.
You will need to experiment.

The one thing everyone asks me how to do is how to remove things from their town.
For example, be nice to someone and remove poorly placed rock 'seeds', or to be mean and remove a building.
The basic "tweed" process described above is what you need.
Decide which item you want to delete in your friend's town.
Create an "AR DS" code which turns that area into weeds.
A rough guess is usually ok. Make a 3x3 block of weeds so you don't have to be perfect.
Then visit their town and use the "AR DS" code to create a block of weeds on top of the rock/building you want to remove.
Then get plucking. Get rid of the weeds and it will get rid of whatever was under them.
For removing buildings, you (and your host) will have to enter and leave a house for the changes to be visible.
Dangerous, but can be fun.

<H2>AR DS Alone</H2>
Some things are possible with "AR DS" alone (but it is more work and more risk).
This is a poor substitute for the map editor.

I do not recommend it, however it is asked a lot, so I'll give you a few hints on what you want to do.

Start with the Simple map from
<A HREF="ac_mapedit.htm#DEMOS">the demo towns</A>.
Work through the basic map editor operations, and maybe some of the advanced ones.
Then, like described above, you need to guess what the town (your town) looks like.
Use the regular river editor to layout the basic flow of the river, falls, bridges.
Then place the buildings.
Try to make it match your real town as best you can.
Then you can do some of the tricks described above using the DUC file that approximates your town.

If you can't figure it out, go buy an "AR MAX/DUO" which is the recommended safe and powerful way of editing your town.
