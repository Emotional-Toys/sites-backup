<H3>Basic Operations - main, adding money</H3>
<P></P>
<P></P>
See the picture above for the main dialog (in basic mode)
<BR>
In the upper left are the properties for your main resident (the first player).
You can see the cash, bank balance and nook points.
Press the "Add 100K" button to add 100,000 bells to your pocket money.
Press the "Add 1M" button to add 1,000,000 bells to your bank balance.
Repeat as necessary. Totals are limited to the max values permitted by the game.
<BR>
Press the "Edit Inventory" button to edit the Inventory (the 15 items in your pockets)
Press the "Edit Emotions" button to edit your four emotions/expressions (described in detail below)
<P></P>
Press the "Edit World Map" button to edit the world map (described in more detail below)
Press the "Edit Rooms" button to edit the rooms in your house, but only if you have a big one.
Press the "Edit Neighbors" button to modify your neighbors (described in more detail below)
<BR>
When done with all your changes, press the "FINAL SAVE" button to update the file on your PC.

<P></P>
<P></P>
<H3>Basic Operation - Editor User Interface</H3>
Many of the editor sub-dialogs are similar.
At the top are 3 main mode buttons "What is it?", "Place/Change" and "Delete".
<BR>
On the left hand side is the grid that you are editing. Each little square or rectangle represents one cell on the grid.
What you are editing changes depending on the editor (inventory, world map, rooms).
<BR>
For smaller grids, the rectangles will contain the hex code of the cell (eg: for the inventory or the simple room editing).
For larger grids, small squares will be shown instead.
<BR>
On the right hand side is the parts list -- a list of applicable things to place on the grid you are editing.
<P></P>
At the bottom may be special buttons as well as the "Save Changes" and "Undo/Cancel" buttons.
<BR>
The three main modes are described below:
<P></P>
<LI>Reviewing: To examine what is already there, press the "What is it?" button at the top (if not already pressed).
Then click the mouse on the cell that interests you.
It will be described at the top ("You clicked on ...") and should automatically be selected in the parts list.
<LI>Placing: Press the "Place/Change" button at the top (if not already pressed).
Then select a part from the parts list. Click on the grid to place the item.
Dragging the mouse is allowed.
<BR>TIP: To quickly clone/copy an object on the map, press the "What is it?" button, click on the cell of the object to clone/copy, press the "Place/Change" button and draw the cloned items somewhere else on the grid.
<LI>Deleting: Press the "Delete" button at the top (if not already pressed).
Then wherever you draw in the grid will be deleted (there are restrictions for houses on the world map)

<P></P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="acmap_ss2.gif"></CENTER>
<P></P>

<H3>Editing your Inventory</H3>
You can change the contents of the 15 inventory slots.
The parts list consists of "Items" (things you use) as well as room "Features" (commonly used to decorate your house).
<BR>
NOTE: since are only 15 inventory slots, you may run out of space.
You can easily place the extra items/features on the world map, or inside your house. Then when you run the game you can go pick them up and use them.
</UL>

<H3>Editing your Emotions</H3>
In the regular game, Dr. Shrunk may drop by infrequently to teach you emotions.
You can learn up to 4 emotions. To express them you press one of four buttons in the chat window and your character will perform a little animation sometimes with sound effects (eg: puffs of smoke coming from your head).
<BR>
There are 29 regular emotions. They will appear with proper icons on the buttons. They have the official names (from the game, eg: fear or shyness).
<BR>
There are 30 other special emotions/animations. They will not have proper icons on the buttons (they will be blank or scrambled graphics).
They have names in parenthesis (I made up the names).
Some are fun, some are boring. Experiment and see if you like any of them.

<P></P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="acmap_ss9.jpg"></CENTER>
<P></P>

<H3>Edit World Map</H3>
This is the most useful feature IMHO.
<BR>
The world map consists of 64x64 cells.
You will see where the houses, trees and other things are on the map.
The background/backdrop like the river, ocean, bridges and cobblestone pads are shown on the map. You can turn this on or off ("backdrop on/off" button).
You can place items floating in the river if you like.
<BR>
In addition to Items and Features, the parts list contains "Terrain" parts,
including: planted flowers, trees (in various stages of growth), stumps, rocks and other things.
Colors are used to show off different kinds of things on the world map.
TIP: Use rocks to create walls or rock mazes.
<P></P>
Items that are buried have a small "X".
The mode button "Bury/UnBury" will let you quickly bury or unbury items. Not all items can be buried.
<P></P>

<P></P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="acmap_ss10.jpg"></CENTER>
NEW:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="acmap_ss10x.jpg"></CENTER>
NEW: On the concrete areas, you will see small pink "x"s. You should have a building (dark red) on that spot.
NEW: the world map is broken down into 'acres' for your convenience. Each 'acre' is 16x16 cells (there are 4x4 = 16 acres/tiles).
You can adjust the background acres by using the river editing features (under advanced)
<P></P>

At the bottom, there are special buttons:
<UL>
<LI>Water all flowers - turns flowers into "just watered" status. They should bloom the next day.
<LI>Revive all flowers - turns flowers into full bloom status.
<BR>The game may override your watering depending on the time between the backup and the restoration of the gamesave.
<LI>Remove Weeds - removes common weeds
<LI>Remove Strays - removes Items or Features dropped on the world map (if buried, it fills in the hole for you)
<LI>Remove Plants/Trees - major destruction
<LI>Remove Rocks - major destruction
</UL>
As always remember press "Save Changes" after making changes (or "Undo/Cancel" if you make a big mistake)

<P></P>
<H3>Edit Rooms - inside your house</H3>
NOTE: the room editor assumes you have a fully grown house. If you haven't grown your house to full size, do not place items in rooms that hasn't been expanded.
If you have a small main room, or no 2nd floor, then use money or bank buttons to pay off your mortgage and get a bigger house before trying this feature.
<P>NOTES:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If items are large, they may require two or four cells (eg: couches usually need 2 cells, the moon need 4 cells). If you don't leave enough room, the second item may disappear.
<LI>There is a limit on the number of items in a room. In the normal game it complains about the floor about to give out.
When trying new combinations, keep the items simple and spaced out.
<LI>When "Features" (furnature, decorations) are placed using the editor, they all face the same direction.
To rotate items, run the game (ie. the editor will add stuff, but you will likely have to arrange the furnature the right way)
<LI>Alternatively, for simple room arrangement, you can use the editor to
place the "Features" (furnature, decorations) on the world map right outside your house.
Then run the game, and using your Animal Crossing character bring in the furnature and arrange it the manual way.
NOTE: many tricky combinations of home decorations will not be possible.
<LI>If your main room is not fully grown (less than 8x8) be sure to place items in the center of the room. I recommend you wait until you have a large enough house before using this feature.
<LI>The top most floor (the bedroom) is not editable
</UL>
<P></P>

<H3>Edit Neighbors</H3>
You can edit your neighbors.
The user interface is relatively simple. Find the neighbor you want to change (one of the possible 8 "NPC"s), and press the "Change" button next to it.
You can change the species of each of your neighbors.
Species list includes the 6 special monkey species: Champ, Nana, Simon, Tammi, Monty, Elise.
You can change the gender and personality of your neighbors. There are 3 male personalities (Lazy, Jock, Cranky) and 3 female personalities (Normal, Peppy, Snooty).
You can change their catch-phrase (max of 10 characters).
Each NPC has one "catchphrase", but up to 8 individual "nicknames" for the people(/players) they have met (see the "Edit Relationships" button below)

<P></P>
Press "Room Contents" for a map editor for the neigbors room contents.
<BR>
The upper grid has two boxes. The first one is for the wallpaper (only put wallpaper there) and the second one is for flooring (only put flooring there).
If these are empty (or contain bogus items), the game will pick the default wallpaper/flooring for that house.
<BR>
The lower grid has 10 boxes. These are laid out in a specific pattern based on the house (usually around the walls and a few in the center). Put items of interest there, and run the game to see how it lays them out in the house.
(a future version of the editor may allow more detailed layout)

<P></P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="acmap_ss12.jpg"></CENTER>
<P></P>

<P></P>
NEW: Press "Edit Relationships" for another dialog that lets you view who has met with your NPC (up to 8).
There should be one record for you, and other records for the people who have come to your town and talked to that NPC.
You can change the nickname the NPC uses to talk to each player.
The nickname may or may not be the same as the player's name.
