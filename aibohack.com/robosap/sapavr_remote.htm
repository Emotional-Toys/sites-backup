NOTE: The RS-232 console is always enabled. Many of the commands here have similar command line equivalents.
Please see the <A HREF="sapavr_console.htm">SapAvr console commands</A> page for more details.
<P></P>
In enhanced mode, these standard features no longer work.
<UL>
<LI>The "S>>" button become a special shift.
<LI>The ability to program and run sensor routines is very different
<LI>The ability to program and run the main program is very different
<LI>The hand and feet sensors are considered separate events (ie. the left hand will no longer do the same thing as the left heel/toe, unless you program it that way)
<LI>The IR signals from the remote are not directly transmitted to the robot. Instead they are first decoded by the "AVR" 2nd CPU.
Some signals stop there, some are changed to other IR codes, but most are passed through.
</UL>

<P></P>
Initially RoboSapien starts in standard mode and will act like a stock RoboSapien (no new features).
You can change the default boot mode (stored in E2PROM) from 'standard' to 'enhanced'.
<BR>
In standard mode:
<UL>
<LI>RoboSapien should work as usual, with no new features
<LI>Hand, toe and heel sensors all act the same (no disambuation)
<LI>The special button sequence of {TBD} will switch into 'enchanced' mode (see below). Use the "E2" command from the console for now.
<LI>The SapAvr console is available for polling and other features, but many features don't make sense in 'standard' mode.
</UL>

<P></P>
In enhanced mode, there are plenty of new features.
Most start with the new Special Shift key "S>>".
NOTE: a work in progress. Actual key sequences are in flux.
<BR>//REVIEW: replace with graphics for unlableled keys
<UL>
<BR>Currently working:<BR>
<LI>"S>>" + "^^^" (walk forward) - Execute Main #1
<LI>"S>>" + "<" (turn right) - Execute Main #2
<LI>"S>>" + [O] (stop - Execute Main #3
<LI>"S>>" + ">" (turn left) - Execute Main #4
<LI>"S>>" + "VVV" (walk backward) - Execute Main #5
<BR>
NOTE: layout on the remote keypad for the 5 direction keys:
<pre>
            1
          2 3 4
            5
</pre>
<LI>"S>>" + right_arm_up - raise both arms
<LI>"S>>" + right_arm_out - move both arms
<LI>"S>>" + right_arm_in - move both arms
<LI>"S>>" + right_arm_down - move both arms

<BR>Not Yet fully implemented:<BR>
<LI>"S>>" + {TBD} - enter enhanced mode (does nothing since we are already there)
<LI>"S>>" + {TBD} - exit enhanced mode (go back to standard mode)
<LI>"S>>" + "S>>" - program the sonic sensor routine (like the regular "S>>" button)
<LI>"S>>" + "L>>" - program the left foot sensor routine
<LI>"S>>" + "R>>" - program the right foot sensor routine
<LI>"S>>" + SHIFT + "L>>" - program the left hand sensor routine
<LI>"S>>" + SHIFT + "R>>" - program the right hand sensor routine
<LI>"S>>" + SHIFT + "" - program the right hand sensor routine
<LI>"S>>" + SHIFT + 1 of 5 directions - program a main routine (#1 to #5)
<LI>"S>>" + {TBD} - erase all E2PROM programming (start over)
<LI>others TBD
</UL>

<P></P>
<H2>Recording (enhanced mode)</H2>
NOTE: the following describes the current functionality - subject to change
<BR>
In enhanced mode, the SapAvr chip is a macro recorder.
The timing between steps is important.
....

<BR>//REVIEW: add more detail here
